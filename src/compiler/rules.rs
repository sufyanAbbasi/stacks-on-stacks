enum Rule {
    // 101.1. Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule 104.3a).
    RULE_101_1_CARDS_TAKE_PRECEDENCE,

    // 101.2. When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence.
    // 101.2a. Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. (See rule 113.10.)
    RULE_101_2a_CANT_TAKES_PRECEDENCE(Condition),

    // 101.3. Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)
    RULE_101_3_IMPOSSIBLE_ACTIONS_IGNORED,

    // 101.4. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.
    RULE_101_4_APNAP_CHOICE_ORDER,

    // 103.6. Some cards allow a player to take actions with them from their opening hand. Once the mulligan process (see rule 103.5) is complete, the starting player may take any such actions in any order. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.
    // 103.6a. If a card allows a player to begin the game with that card on the battlefield, the player taking this action puts that card onto the battlefield.
    // 103.6b. If a card allows a player to reveal it from their opening hand, the player taking this action does so. The card remains revealed until the first turn begins. Each card may be revealed this way only once.
    RULE_103_6b_FIRST_ACTION_FROM_OPENING_HAND(Condition),

    // 103.8. The starting player takes their first turn.
    RULE_103_8_FIRST_TURN,

    // 103.8a. In a two-player game, the player who plays first skips the draw step (see rule 504, “Draw Step”) of their first turn.
    RULE_103_8a_TWO_PLAYER_SKIP_DRAW(Condition),

    // 104.1. A game ends immediately when a player wins, when the game is a draw, or when the game is restarted.
    RULE_104_1_GAME_ENDS(Condition),

    // 104.2. There are several ways to win the game.
    // 104.2a. A player still in the game wins the game if that player’s opponents have all left the game. This happens immediately and overrides all effects that would preclude that player from winning the game.
    // 104.2b. An effect may state that a player wins the game.
    RULE_104_2b_PLAYER_WINS(Condition),

    // 104.3. There are several ways to lose the game.
    // 104.3a. A player can concede the game at any time. A player who concedes leaves the game immediately. That player loses the game.
    // 104.3b. If a player’s life total is 0 or less, that player loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 104.3c. If a player is required to draw more cards than are left in their library, they draw the remaining cards and then lose the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 104.3d. If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 104.3e. An effect may state that a player loses the game.
    // 104.3f. If a player would both win and lose the game simultaneously, that player loses the game.
    // 104.3j. In a Commander game, a player who’s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704. See also rule 903.10.)
    RULE_104_3_PLAYER_LOSES(Condition),

    // 104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw.
    // 104.4a. If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.
    // 104.4b. If a game that’s not using the limited range of influence option (including a two-player game) somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw. Loops that contain an optional action don’t result in a draw.
    // 104.4c. An effect may state that the game is a draw.
    // 104.5. If a player loses the game, that player leaves the game. If the game is a draw for a player, that player leaves the game. The multiplayer rules handle what happens when a player leaves the game; see rule 800.4.
    RULE_104_5_PLAYER_DRAWS(Condition),

    // 104.6. One card (Karn Liberated) restarts the game. All players still in the game when it restarts then immediately begin a new game. See rule 727, “Restarting the Game.”
    RULE_104_6_RESTART_GAME(Condition),

    // 105.5. If an effect refers to a color pair, it means exactly two of the five colors. There are ten color pairs: white and blue, white and black, blue and black, blue and red, black and red, black and green, red and green, red and white, green and white, and green and blue.
    RULE_105_5_EFFECT_REFERS_COLOR_PAIR(Condition),

    // 105.3. Effects may change an object’s color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the object became that color “in addition” to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become colorless.
    // 105.4. If a player is asked to choose a color, they must choose one of the five colors. “Multicolored” is not a color. Neither is “colorless.”
    RULE_105_4_OBJECT_HAS_NEW_COLOR(Condition),

    // 106.3. Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule 605). It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that aren’t mana abilities. A spell or ability that produces mana instructs a player to add that mana. If mana is produced by a spell, the source of that mana is that spell. If mana is produced by an ability, the source of that mana is the source of that ability (see rule 113.7).
    RULE_106_3_MANA_IS_ADDED_TO_POOL(Condition),

    // 106.4. When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a player’s mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the player’s mana pool as unspent mana. Each player’s mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracle™ card reference to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.
    RULE_106_4_MANA_POOLS_EMPTY_AT_END_OF_STEP_OR_PHASE(Condition),

    // 106.5. If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.
    RULE_106_5_UNDEFINED_MANA_PRODUCED_NO_MANA(Condition),

    // 106.6. Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see rule 603.7a) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesn’t affect the mana’s type.
    RULE_106_6_MANA_HAS_RESTRICTION(Condition),

    // 106.6a. Some replacement effects increase the amount of mana produced by a spell or ability. In these cases, any restrictions or additional effects created by the spell or ability will apply to all mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the mana is spent, a separate delayed triggered ability is created for each mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a continuous effect or replacement effect if the mana is spent, a separate effect is created once for each mana produced.
    RULE_106_6a_MANA_RESTRICTIONS_APPLY_TO_ADDITIONAL_MANA_EFFECTS(Condition),

    // 106.7. Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents “could produce.” The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid. If that permanent wouldn’t produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this way, there’s no type of mana it could produce.
    RULE_106_7_COULD_ADD_MANA(Condition),

    // 106.8. If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol. If a colored half is chosen, one mana of that color is added to that player’s mana pool. If a generic half is chosen, an amount of colorless mana represented by that half’s number is added to that player’s mana pool.
    RULE_106_8_HYBRID_ADD_MANA_CHOOSE_COLOR(Condition),

    // 106.9. If an effect would add mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, one mana of the color of that symbol is added to that player’s mana pool.
    RULE_106_9_PHYREXIAN_ADD_MANA_COLOR(Condition),

    // 106.10. If an effect would add mana represented by a generic mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.
    RULE_106_10_GENERIC_ADD_MANA_COLOR_IS_COLORLESS(Condition),

    // 106.11. If an effect would add mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols to a player’s mana pool, that much colorless mana is added to that player’s mana pool.
    RULE_106_11_SNOW_ADD_MANA_IS_COLORLESS(Condition),

    // 106.12. To “tap [a permanent] for mana” is to activate a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its activation cost. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”
    RULE_106_12_ACTIVATE_MANA_ABILITY_WITH_TAP_SYMBOL(Condition),

    // 106.12a. An ability that triggers whenever a permanent “is tapped for mana” or is tapped for mana of a specified type triggers whenever such a mana ability resolves and produces mana or the specified type of mana.
    RULE_106_12a_MANA_ABILITIES_TRIGGER(Condition),

    // 106.12b. A replacement effect that applies if a permanent “is tapped for mana” or tapped for mana of a specific type and/or amount modifies the mana production event while such an ability is resolving and producing mana or the specified type and/or amount of mana.
    RULE_106_12b_REPLACEMENT_EFFECTS_AFFECT_MANA_ABILITIES(Condition),

    // 106.13. One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add “the mana lost this way.” (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former player’s mana pool and causes the mana emptied this way to be put into the latter player’s mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that mana.
    RULE_106_13_DRAIN_POWER_MANA_CONDITIONS_CARRY_OVER(Condition),

    // 107.1. The only numbers the Magic game uses are integers.
    // 107.1a. You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.
    // 107.1c. If a rule or ability instructs a player to choose “any number,” that player may choose any positive number or zero.
    // 107.1b. Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can’t choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it’s possible for a game value, such as a creature’s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles, triples, or sets to a specific value a player’s life total or the power and/or toughness of a creature or creature card.
    RULE_107_1_POSITIVE_INTEGER_VALUES_ONLY,

    // 107.2. If anything needs to use a number that can’t be determined, either as a result or in a calculation, it uses 0 instead.
    RULE_107_2_UNDEFINED_NUMBERS_ARE_ZERO,

    // 107.3. Many objects use the letter X as a placeholder for a number that needs to be determined. Some objects have abilities that define the value of X; the rest let their controller choose the value of X.
    // 107.3a. If a spell or activated ability has a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, and/or activation cost with an {X}, [-X], or X in it, and the value of X isn’t defined by the text of that spell or ability, the controller of that spell or ability chooses and announces the value of X as part of casting the spell or activating the ability. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.
    // 107.3b. If a player is casting a spell that has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of X isn’t defined by the text of that spell, and an effect lets that player cast that spell while paying neither its mana cost nor an alternative cost that includes X, then the only legal choice for X is 0. This doesn’t apply to effects that only reduce a cost, even if they reduce it to zero. See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”
    // 107.3c. If a spell or activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its cost and/or its text, and the value of X is defined by the text of that spell or ability, then that’s the value of X while that spell or ability is on the stack. The controller of that spell or ability doesn’t get to choose the value. Note that the value of X may change while that spell or ability is on the stack.
    // 107.3d. If a cost associated with a special action, such as a suspend cost or a morph cost, has an {X} or an X in it, the value of X is chosen by the player taking the special action immediately before they pay that cost.
    // 107.3e. If a spell or ability refers to the {X} or X in the mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost of another object, any X in that spell or ability’s text uses the value of X used by the other object.
    // 107.3f. Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost. If the value of X isn’t defined, the controller of the spell or ability chooses the value of X at the appropriate time (either as it’s put on the stack or as it resolves).
    // 107.3g. If a card in any zone other than the stack has an {X} in its mana cost, the value of {X} is treated as 0, even if the value of X is defined somewhere within its text.
    // 107.3h. If an effect instructs a player to pay an object’s mana cost that includes {X}, the value of X is treated as 0 unless the object is a spell on the stack. In that case, the value of X is the value chosen or determined for it as the spell was cast.
    // 107.3i. Normally, all instances of X on an object have the same value at any given time.
    // 107.3j. If an object gains an ability, the value of X within that ability is the value defined by that ability, or 0 if that ability doesn’t define a value of X. This is an exception to rule 107.3i. This may occur with ability-adding effects, text-changing effects, or copy effects.
    // 107.3k. If an object’s activated ability has an {X}, [-X], or X in its activation cost, the value of X for that ability is independent of any other values of X chosen for that object or for other instances of abilities of that object. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.
    // 107.3m. If an object’s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability or replacement effect refers to X, and the spell that became that object as it resolved had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for that ability is the same as the value of X for that spell, although the value of X for that permanent is 0. This is an exception to rule 107.3i.
    // 107.3n. If a delayed triggered ability created by a resolving spell or ability refers to X, X is not defined in the text of that triggered ability, and the spell or ability that created it had a value of X chosen for any of its costs, the value of X for the triggered ability is the same as the value of X for the spell of ability that created it.
    // 107.3p. Some objects use the letter Y in addition to the letter X. Y follows the same rules as X.
    RULE_107_3_X_IS_CHOSEN_OR_ZERO(Condition),

    // 107.4b. Numerical symbols (such as {1}) and variable symbols (such as {X}) represent generic mana in costs. Generic mana in costs can be paid with any type of mana. For more information about {X}, see rule 107.3.
    RULE_107_4b_NUMERICAL_AND_VARIABLE_MANA_COST_PAID_WITH_GENERIC_MANA,

    // 107.4c. The colorless mana symbol {C} is used to represent one colorless mana, and also to represent a cost that can be paid only with one colorless mana.
    RULE_107_4c_COLORLESS_MANA_COST_CAN_ONLY_BE_PAID_WITH_COLORLESS,

    // 107.4d. The symbol {0} represents zero mana and is used as a placeholder for a cost that can be paid with no resources. (See rule 118.5.)
    RULE_107_4d_ZERO_MANA_COST,

    // 107.4e. A hybrid mana symbol is also a colored mana symbol, even if one of its components is colorless. Each one represents a cost that can be paid in one of two ways, as represented by the two halves of the symbol. A hybrid symbol such as {W/U} can be paid with either white or blue mana, and a monocolored hybrid symbol such as {2/B} can be paid with either one black mana or two mana of any type. A hybrid mana symbol is all of its component colors.
    RULE_107_4e_HYBRID_MANA_COST_CAN_BE_PAID_WITH_EITHER,

    // 107.4f. Phyrexian mana symbols are colored mana symbols: {W/P} is white, {U/P} is blue, {B/P} is black, {R/P} is red, and {G/P} is green. A Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid either with one mana of its color or by paying 2 life. There are also ten hybrid Phyrexian mana symbols. A hybrid Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid with one mana of either of its component colors or by paying 2 life. A hybrid Phyrexian mana symbol is both of its component colors.
    RULE_107_4f_PHYREXIAN_MANA_COST_CAN_BE_PAID_WITH_LIFE,

    // 107.4h. When used in a cost, the snow mana symbol {S} represents a cost that can be paid with one mana of any type produced by a snow source (see rule 106.3). Effects that reduce the amount of generic mana you pay don’t affect {S} costs. The {S} symbol can also be used to refer to mana of any type produced by a snow source spent to pay a cost. Snow is neither a color nor a type of mana.
    RULE_107_4h_SNOW_MANA_CAN_ONLY_BE_PAID_BY_SNOW_SOURCE,

    // 107.5. The tap symbol is {T}. The tap symbol in an activation cost means “Tap this permanent.” A permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped again to pay the cost. A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.
    RULE_107_5_TAP_SYMBOL_ONLY_ACTIVATES_FOR_UNTAPPED_PERMANENTS_AND_NOT_SUMMONING_SICK(Condition),

    // 107.6. The untap symbol is {Q}. The untap symbol in an activation cost means “Untap this permanent.” A permanent that’s already untapped can’t be untapped again to pay the cost. A creature’s activated ability with the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. See rule 302.6.
    RULE_107_6_UNTAP_SYMBOL_ONLY_ACTIVATES_FOR_TAPPED_PERMANENTS_AND_NOT_SUMMONING_SICK(Condition),

    // 107.7. Each activated ability of a planeswalker has a loyalty symbol in its cost. Positive loyalty symbols point upward and feature a plus sign followed by a number. Negative loyalty symbols point downward and feature a minus sign followed by a number or an X. Neutral loyalty symbols don’t point in either direction and feature a 0. [+N] means “Put N loyalty counters on this permanent,” [-N] means “Remove N loyalty counters from this permanent,” and [0] means “Put zero loyalty counters on this permanent.” Loyalty symbols may also appear in abilities that modify loyalty costs.
    RULE_107_7_PLANESWALKER_LOYALTY_COUNTERS,

    // 107.8. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,” or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as “[P/T].” See rule 711, “Leveler Cards.”
    // 107.8a. “{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”
    // 107.8b. “{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”

    // 107.15. The text box of a Saga card contains chapter symbols, each of which is a keyword ability that represents a triggered ability. A chapter symbol includes a Roman numeral, indicated here as “rN”. The text printed in the text box striation to the right of a chapter symbol is the effect of the triggered ability it represents. See rule 714, “Saga Cards.”
    // 107.15a. “{rN}—[Effect]” means “When one or more lore counters are put onto this Saga, if the number of lore counters on it was less than N and became at least N, [effect].”
    // 107.15b. “{rN1}, {rN2}—[Effect]” is the same as “{rN1}—[Effect]” and “{rN2}—[Effect].”
    RULE_107_15b_SAGA_LORE_COUNTER,

    // 107.16. The text box of a Class card contains class level bars, each of which is a keyword ability that represents both an activated ability and a static ability. A class level bar includes the activation cost of its activated ability and a level number. Any abilities printed within the same text box section as the class level bar are part of its static ability. See rule 716, “Class Cards.”
    RULE_107_16_CLASS_LEVELS,

    // 107.17. The ticket symbol is {TK}. It represents one ticket counter.

    RULE_107_18_PAWPRINT_SYMBOL,

    // 108.3. The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player’s deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule 407.)
    RULE_108_3_OWNER_IS_PLAYER_WHO_BROUGHT_THE_CARD,

    // 108.3b. Some spells and abilities allow a player to take cards they own from outside the game and bring them into the game. (See rule 400.11b.) If a card outside that game is involved in a Magic game, its owner is determined as described in rule 108.3. If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see rule 100.4), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in their sideboard. In all other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.
    RULE_108_3b_OUTSIDE_THE_GAME_IS_SIDEBOARD(Condition),

    // 108.4. A card doesn’t have a controller unless that card represents a permanent or spell; in those cases, its controller is determined by the rules for permanents or spells. See rules 110.2 and 112.2.
    // 108.4a. If anything asks for the controller of a card that doesn’t have one (because it’s not a permanent or spell), use its owner instead.
    RULE_108_4a_ONLY_PERMANENTS_AND_SPELLS_HAVE_CONTROLLERS_THEN_OWNERS(Condition),

    // 109.2. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes a card type or subtype, but doesn’t refer to a specific zone or include the word “card,” “spell,” “source,” or “scheme,” it means a permanent of that card type or subtype on the battlefield.
    RULE_109_2_CARD_TYPE_REFERENCE_ON_BATTLEFIELD(Condition),

    // 109.2a. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “card” and the name of a zone, it means a card matching that description in the stated zone.
    RULE_109_2a_CARD_REFERENCED_IN_ZONE,

    // 109.2b. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “spell,” it means a spell matching that description on the stack.
    RULE_109_2b_SPELL_REFERENCE_ON_STACK,

    // 109.2c. If a spell or ability uses a description of an object that includes the word “source,” it means a source matching that description—a source of an ability, of damage, or of mana—in any zone. See rules 113.7 and 609.7.
    RULE_109_2c_SOURCE_REFERENCE,

    // 109.2d. If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the command zone on which that ability is printed.
    RULE_109_2d_SCHEME_REFERENCE,

    // 109.3. An object’s characteristics are name, mana cost, color, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, abilities, power, toughness, loyalty, defense, hand modifier, and life modifier. Objects can have some or all of these characteristics. Any other information about an object isn’t a characteristic. For example, characteristics don’t include whether a permanent is tapped, a spell’s target, an object’s owner or controller, what an Aura enchants, and so on.
    RULE_109_3_CHARACTERISTIC_REFERENCE,

    // 109.4. Only objects on the stack or on the battlefield have a controller. Objects that are neither on the stack nor on the battlefield aren’t controlled by any player. See rule 108.4. There are six exceptions to this rule:
    // 109.4a. The controller of a mana ability is determined as though it were on the stack. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”
    // 109.4b. A triggered ability that has triggered but is waiting to be placed on the stack is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f. See also rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”
    // 109.4c. An emblem is controlled by the player who puts it into the command zone. See rule 114, “Emblems.”
    RULE_109_4c_CONTROLLER_REFERENCE,

    // 109.5. The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
    RULE_109_5_YOU_YOUR_REFERENCE,

    // 110.1. A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as it’s moved to another zone by an effect or rule.
    RULE_110_1_PERMANENT_REMAINS_ON_BATTLEFIELD,

    // 110.2. A permanent’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless it’s a token; see rule 111.2). A permanent’s controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.
    RULE_110_2_PERMANENT_OWNER_IS_OWNER_CONTROLLER_IS_CONTROLLER,

    // 110.2a. If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player’s control unless the effect states otherwise.
    RULE_110_2a_PLAYER_PUTS_ON_BATTLEFIELD_PUTS_IN_CONTROL,

    // 110.2b. If an effect causes a player to gain control of another player’s permanent spell, the first player controls the permanent that spell becomes, but the permanent’s controller by default is the player who put that spell onto the stack. (This distinction is relevant in multiplayer games; see rule 800.4c.)
    RULE_110_2b_PLAYER_GAINS_CONTROL_OF_PERMANENT_DEFAULTING_TO_PLAYER_WHO_PUT_ON_STACK,

    // 110.3. A nontoken permanent’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
    RULE_110_3_PERMANENT_CHARACTERISTICS_AS_PRINTED_MODIFIED_BY_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS,

    // 110.4. There are six permanent types: artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and sorcery cards can’t enter the battlefield and thus can’t be permanents. Some kindred cards can enter the battlefield and some can’t, depending on their other card types. See section 3, “Card Types.”
    // 110.4a. The term “permanent card” is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
    // 110.4b. The term “permanent spell” is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.
    // 110.4c. If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. It’s still a permanent.
    RULE_110_4c_PERMANENT_TYPE_DEFINITION,

    // 110.5. A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.
    // 110.5a. Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.
    // 110.5b. Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability says otherwise.
    // 110.5c. A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.
    // 110.5d. Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.
    RULE_110_5d_STATUS_DEFINITION,

    // 111.1. Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card.
    RULE_111_1_TOKEN_DEFINITION,

    // 111.2. The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that player’s control.
    RULE_111_2_TOKEN_OWNER,

    // 111.3. The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the token’s “text.” The characteristic values defined this way are functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token’s copiable values. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.
    RULE_111_3_TOKEN_TEXT_DEFINED_BY_SPELL,

    // 111.4. A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability doesn’t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s) plus the word “Token.” Once a token is on the battlefield, changing its name doesn’t change its subtype(s), and vice versa.
    RULE_111_4_TOKEN_NAME_AND_TYPE_SET_BY_SPELL,

    // 111.5. If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or more of that token’s characteristics can’t enter the battlefield, the token is not created. Similarly, if an effect would create a token that is a copy of an instant or sorcery card, no token is created.
    RULE_111_5_TOKENS_DONT_ENTER_IF_RULE_OR_EFFECT_PREVENT_IT,

    // 111.6. A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s card type or subtype. A token isn’t a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a Magic booster pack).
    RULE_111_6_TOKENS_ARE_PERMANENTS_NOT_CARDS,

    // 111.7. A token that’s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see rule 704. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)
    // 111.8. A token that has left the battlefield can’t move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked; see rule 704.
    RULE_111_8_TOKENS_NOT_IN_BATTLEFIELD_DIE,

    // 111.9. Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written “create [name], a . . .” and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the listed characteristics that has the given name.
    RULE_111_9_LEGENDARY_TOKENS_DEFINITION,

    // 111.10. Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below to determine the characteristics the token is created with. The effect that creates a predefined token may also modify or add to the predefined characteristics.
    // 111.10a. A Treasure token is a colorless Treasure artifact token with “{T}, Sacrifice this token: Add one mana of any color.”
    // 111.10b. A Food token is a colorless Food artifact token with “{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this token: You gain 3 life.”
    // 111.10c. A Gold token is a colorless Gold artifact token with “Sacrifice this token: Add one mana of any color.”
    // 111.10d. A Walker token is a 2/2 black Zombie creature token named Walker.
    // 111.10e. A Shard token is a colorless Shard enchantment token with “{2}, Sacrifice this token: Scry 1, then draw a card.”
    // 111.10f. A Clue token is a colorless Clue artifact token with “{2}, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card.”
    // 111.10g. A Blood token is a colorless Blood artifact token with “{1}, {T}, Discard a card, Sacrifice this token: Draw a card.”
    // 111.10h. A Powerstone token is a colorless Powerstone artifact token with “{T}: Add {C}. This mana can’t be spent to cast a nonartifact spell.”
    // 111.10i. An Incubator token is a double-faced token. Its front face is a colorless Incubator artifact with “{2}: Transform this token.” Its back face is a 0/0 colorless Phyrexian artifact creature named Phyrexian Token.
    // 111.10j. A Cursed Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Cursed with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature has base power and toughness 1/1.”
    // 111.10k. A Monster Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Monster with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has trample.”
    // 111.10m. A Royal Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Royal with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has ward {1}.”
    // 111.10n. A Sorcerer Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Sorcerer with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has ‘Whenever this creature attacks, scry 1.’”
    // 111.10p. A Virtuous Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Virtuous with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 for each enchantment you control.”
    // 111.10q. A Wicked Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Wicked with enchant creature, “Enchanted creature gets +1/+1,” and “When this token is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, each opponent loses 1 life.”
    // 111.10r. A Young Hero Role token is a colorless Aura Role enchantment token named Young Hero with enchant creature and “Enchanted creature has ‘Whenever this creature attacks, if its toughness is 3 or less, put a +1/+1 counter on it.’”
    // 111.10s. A Map token is a colorless Map artifact token with “{1}, {T}, Sacrifice this token: Target creature you control explores. Activate only as a sorcery.” See rule 701.44, “Explore.”
    // 111.10t. A Junk token is a colorless Junk artifact token with “{T}, Sacrifice this token: Exile the top card of your library. You may play that card this turn. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    // 111.10u. A Lander token is a colorless Lander artifact token with “{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this token: Search your library for a basic land card, put it onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle.”
    RULE_111_10u_PREDEFINED_TOKENS,

    // 112.1. A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule 601, “Casting Spells”), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its owner’s hand. (See rule 405, “Stack.”) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule 608, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”), is countered (see rule 701.6), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see section 6, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”
    // 112.1a. A copy of a spell is also a spell, even if it has no card associated with it. See rule 707.10.
    // 112.1b. Some effects allow a player to cast a copy of a card; if the player does, that copy is a spell as well. See rule 707.12.
    RULE_112_1b_SPELL_DEFINITION,

    // 112.2. A spell’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless it’s a copy. In that case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spell’s controller is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.
    // 112.2a. Some effects instruct a player to create a copy of a card and say they may cast it. In that case, the owner of that copy is the player who is instructed to create it and given permission to cast it.
    RULE_112_2a_SPELL_OWNER,

    // 112.3. A noncopy spell’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
    RULE_112_3_SPELL_CHARACTERISTICS_MODIFIED_BY_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS,

    // 112.4. If an effect of a resolving spell or ability changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves. See rule 400.7.
    RULE_112_4_SPELL_CHARACTERISTIC_CHANGES_CONTINUE_TO_RESOLUTION,

    // 113.1. An ability can be one of three things:
    // 113.1a. An ability can be a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An object’s abilities are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by rules or effects. (Effects that grant abilities usually use the words “has,” “have,” “gains,” or “gain.”) Abilities generate effects. (See rule 609, “Effects.”)
    // 113.1b. An ability can be something that a player has that changes how the game affects the player. A player normally has no abilities unless granted to that player by effects.
    // 113.1c. An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object. (See section 6, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”)
    RULE_113_1c_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.2b. An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.
    RULE_113_2b_ABILITIES_INCLUDE_ADDITIONAL_COSTS,

    // 113.2c. An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule 702, “Keyword Abilities”), each paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.
    RULE_113_2c_ABILITIES_CAN_BE_STACKED_SEPARATED_BY_PARAGRAPHS,

    // 113.2d. Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rule 609, “Effects.”
    RULE_113_2d_ABILITIES_ARE_ONE_SHOT_OR_CONTINUOUS,

    // 113.3a. Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it’s an activated ability, a triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule 113.6.
    RULE_113_3a_SPELL_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.3b. Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]” A player may activate such an ability whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it on the stack, where it remains until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule 602, “Activating Activated Abilities.”
    RULE_113_3b_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.3c. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger condition], [effect],” and include (and usually begin with) the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”
    RULE_113_3c_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.3d. Static abilities are written as statements. They’re simply true. Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule 604, “Handling Static Abilities.”
    RULE_113_3d_STATIC_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.4. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They don’t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if they don’t have priority. See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”
    RULE_113_4_MANA_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

    // 113.5. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”
    RULE_113_5_LOYALTY_ABILITIES_DEFINITION,

To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
    RULE_113_7_SOURCE_DEFINITION,

    // 113.7a. Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, “This creature deals 1 damage to any target”) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.
    RULE_113_7a_ABILITIES_ON_STACK_ARE_INDEPENDENT_OF_SOURCE,

    // 113.8. The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability’s source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
    RULE_113_8_CONTROLLER_OF_ABILITY_ON_STACK_IS_THE_PLAYER_WHO_ACTIVATED,

    // 113.9. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren’t spells, and therefore can’t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities don’t use the stack and thus can’t be countered at all.

    // 113.11. Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object “can’t have” that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. It’s also impossible for an effect or keyword counter to add that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability won’t apply to that object.
    RULE_113_11_EFFECTS_THAT_SAY_CANT_HAVE_PREVENT_THE_ABILITY_FROM_BEING_ADDED_BUT_LET_OTHERS_GO_THROUGH,

    // 113.12. An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object “gains” or “has” an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (“[permanent] is [characteristic value]”), it’s not granting an ability. (See rule 604.3.) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (“[creature] can’t be blocked,” for example), it’s neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic.
    RULE_113_12_EFFECT_SETTING_CHARACTERISTIC_IS_NOT_AN_ABILITY,

    // 115. Targets

    // 115.1. Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets can’t be changed except by another spell or ability that explicitly says it can do so.
    RULE_115_1_SPELLS_AND_ABILITIES_MAY_REQUIRE_TARGETS,

    // 115.1a. An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. (If an activated or triggered ability of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)
    RULE_115_1a_INSTANT_SORCERY_TARGETED_IF_PHRASE_USED,

    // 115.1b. Aura spells are always targeted. An Aura’s target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, “Enchant”). The target is chosen as the spell is cast; see rule 601.2c. An Aura permanent doesn’t target anything; only the spell is targeted. (An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also be targeted.)
    RULE_115_1b_AURA_SPELLS_ALWAYS_TARGETED,

    // 115.1c. An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is activated; see rule 602.2b.
    RULE_115_1c_ACTIVATED_ABILITY_TARGETED_IF_PHRASE_USED,

    // 115.1d. A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule 603.3d.
    RULE_115_1d_TRIGGERED_ABILITY_TARGETED_IF_PHRASE_USED,

    // 115.1e. Some keyword abilities, such as equip and modular, represent targeted activated or triggered abilities, and some keyword abilities, such as mutate, cause spells to have targets. In those cases, the phrase “target [something]” appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself. (The keyword’s reminder text will often contain the word “target.”) See rule 702, “Keyword Abilities.”
    RULE_115_1e_KEYWORD_ABILITIES_MAY_REPRESENT_TARGETED_ABILITIES,

    // 115.2. Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that can’t exist on the battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule 115.4.
    RULE_115_2_TARGETS_MUST_BE_PERMANENTS_UNLESS_SPECIFIED(Condition),

    // 115.3. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on a spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability (see rule 115.7).
    RULE_115_3_TARGET_CANNOT_BE_CHOSEN_MULTIPLE_TIMES_PER_INSTANCE,

    // 115.4. Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require “any target,” “another target,” “two targets,” or similar rather than “target [something].” These targets may be creatures, players, planeswalkers, or battles. Other game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, can’t be chosen.
    RULE_115_4_ANY_TARGET_INCLUDES_CREATURES_PLAYERS_PLANESWALKERS_BATTLES,

    // 115.5. A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.
    RULE_115_5_SPELL_OR_ABILITY_ILLEGAL_TARGET_FOR_ITSELF,

    // 115.6. A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for it.
    RULE_115_6_SPELL_MAY_ALLOW_ZERO_TARGETS,

    // 115.7a. If an effect allows a player to “change the target(s)” of a spell or ability, each target can be changed only to another legal target. If a target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets aren’t changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed.
    RULE_115_7a_CHANGE_TARGETS_MUST_BE_LEGAL,

    // 115.7b. If an effect allows a player to “change a target” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule 115.7a is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).
    RULE_115_7b_CHANGE_SINGLE_TARGET_MUST_BE_LEGAL,

    // 115.7c. If an effect allows a player to “change any targets” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule 115.7a is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).
    RULE_115_7c_CHANGE_ANY_TARGETS_MUST_BE_LEGAL,

    // 115.7d. If an effect allows a player to “choose new targets” for a spell or ability, the player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become illegal.
    RULE_115_7d_CHOOSE_NEW_TARGETS_CAN_LEAVE_ILLEGAL_UNCHANGED,

    // 115.7e. When changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability, only the final set of targets is evaluated to determine whether the change is legal.
    RULE_115_7e_ONLY_FINAL_SET_OF_TARGETS_EVALUATED,

    // 115.7f. A spell or ability may “divide” or “distribute” an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that spell or ability, the original division can’t be changed.
    RULE_115_7f_DIVIDED_EFFECT_DISTRIBUTION_CANNOT_CHANGE,

    // 115.8. Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal spell or ability, doesn’t allow that player to change its mode. (See rule 700.2.)
    RULE_115_8_CHANGING_TARGETS_DOES_NOT_CHANGE_MODE,

    // 115.9a. An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] with [a number of] targets” checks the number of times any object or player was chosen as the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once, each of those instances is counted separately.
    RULE_115_9a_CHECK_NUMBER_OF_TARGETS_AT_CAST_TIME,

    // 115.9b. An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets [something]” checks the current state of that spell or ability’s targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is still in the game, that target’s current information is used, even if it’s not currently legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.
    RULE_115_9b_CHECK_CURRENT_STATE_OF_TARGETS,

    // 115.9c. An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets only [something]” checks the number of different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player multiple times), the current state of that spell or ability’s target is checked as described in rule 115.9b.
    RULE_115_9c_CHECK_ONLY_SOMETHING_TARGETS_AT_CAST_TIME,

    // 115.10. Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don’t target. In general, those objects and players aren’t chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule 608, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”
    RULE_115_10_SPELLS_CAN_AFFECT_UNTARGETED_OBJECTS,

    // 115.10a. Just because an object or player is being affected by a spell or ability doesn’t make that object or player a target of that spell or ability. Unless that object or player is identified by the word “target” in the text of that spell or ability, or the rule for that keyword ability, it’s not a target.
    RULE_115_10a_AFFECTED_IS_NOT_TARGETED,

    RULE_115_10b_YOU_DOES_NOT_INDICATE_TARGET,

    // 116. Special Actions

    // 116.1. Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that don’t use the stack. These are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates automatically. (See rule 703, “Turn-Based Actions,” and rule 704, “State-Based Actions.”)
    RULE_116_1_SPECIAL_ACTIONS_DO_NOT_USE_STACK,

    // 116.2a. Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during each of their turns. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. See rule 305, “Lands.”
    RULE_116_2a_PLAYING_LAND_IS_SPECIAL_ACTION,

    // 116.2b. Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”
    RULE_116_2b_TURNING_FACE_DOWN_CREATURE_UP_IS_SPECIAL_ACTION,

    // 116.2c. Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority, unless that effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as the effect allows it.
    RULE_116_2c_LATER_ACTION_TO_END_EFFECT_IS_SPECIAL_ACTION,

    // 116.2i. In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. See rule 901, “Planechase.”

    // 118.8a. Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it’s being cast or to an ability as it’s being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs as described in rule 601.2b.
    RULE_118_8a_MULTIPLE_ADDITIONAL_COSTS_ALLOWED,
    
    // 118.8d. Additional costs don’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.
    RULE_118_8d_ADDITIONAL_COSTS_DO_NOT_CHANGE_MANA_COST,
    
    // 118.9. Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell’s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell’s mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, “You may [action] rather than pay [this object’s] mana cost,” or “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.” Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule 702.
    RULE_118_9_ALTERNATIVE_COSTS_DEFINITION,
    
    // 118.9a. Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it’s being cast. The controller of the spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule 601.2b.
    RULE_118_9a_ONLY_ONE_ALTERNATIVE_COST_ALLOWED,
    
    // 118.9d. If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule 601.2f.)
    RULE_118_9d_MODIFIERS_APPLY_TO_ALTERNATIVE_COST,
    
    // 118.10. Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can’t sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn’t pay another spell or ability’s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.
    RULE_118_10_COST_PAYMENT_IS_SINGLE_USE,
    
    // 118.12. Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something]. If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” Or “[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The “If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t]” clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.
    RULE_118_12_OPTIONAL_ACTION_COSTS_ON_RESOLUTION,
    
    // 119.2. Damage dealt to a player normally causes that player to lose that much life. See rule 120.3.
    RULE_119_2_DAMAGE_CAUSES_LIFE_LOSS,
    
    // 119.4. If a cost or effect allows a player to pay an amount of life greater than 0, the player may do so only if their life total is greater than or equal to the amount of the payment. If a player pays life, the payment is subtracted from their life total; in other words, the player loses that much life.
    RULE_119_4_CANT_PAY_LIFE_IF_INSUFFICIENT,
    
    // 119.5. If an effect sets a player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total.
    RULE_119_5_SETTING_LIFE_TOTAL_CAUSES_GAIN_OR_LOSS,
    
    // 119.6. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game as a state-based action. See rule 704.
    RULE_119_6_ZERO_LIFE_IS_GAME_LOSS,
    
    // 119.7. If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the player’s life total would become higher; in that case, the exchange won’t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player can’t receive a new life total such that the player’s life total would become higher. In addition, a cost that involves having that player gain life can’t be paid, and a replacement effect that would replace a life gain event affecting that player won’t do anything.
    RULE_119_7_CANT_GAIN_LIFE_PREVENTS_INCREASES,
    
    // 119.8. If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, that player can’t make an exchange such that the player’s life total would become lower; in that case, the exchange won’t happen. Similarly, if an effect redistributes life totals, a player can’t receive a new life total such that the player’s life total would become lower. In addition, a cost that involves having that player pay life can’t be paid.
    RULE_119_8_CANT_LOSE_LIFE_PREVENTS_DECREASES,
    
    // 120.1. Objects can deal damage to battles, creatures, planeswalkers, and players. This is generally detrimental to the object or player that receives that damage. An object that deals damage is the source of that damage.
    RULE_120_1_DAMAGE_RECIPIENTS,
    
    // 120.3. Damage may have one or more of the following results, depending on whether the recipient of the damage is a player or permanent, the characteristics of the damage’s source, and the characteristics of the damage’s recipient (if it’s a permanent).
    RULE_120_3_DAMAGE_RESULTS_VARY_BY_CHARACTERISTICS,
    
    // 120.4. Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.
    RULE_120_4_DAMAGE_PROCESSING_SEQUENCE,
    
    // 120.5. Damage dealt to a creature, planeswalker, or battle doesn’t destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage doesn’t destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or otherwise put a permanent into its owner’s graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule 704.
    RULE_120_5_DAMAGE_DOES_NOT_DIRECTLY_DESTROY,
    
    // 120.6. Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule 704). All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule 701.19, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule 514.2).
    RULE_120_6_DAMAGE_REMAINS_UNTIL_CLEANUP,
    
    // 120.8. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won’t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
    RULE_120_8_ZERO_DAMAGE_IS_NOT_DEALT,
    
    // 121.2. Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.
    RULE_121_2_DRAW_CARDS_ONE_AT_A_TIME,
    
    // 121.3. If there are no cards in a player’s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can’t draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can’t choose to do so.
    RULE_121_3_CAN_CHOOSE_TO_DRAW_FROM_EMPTY_LIBRARY,
    
    // 121.4. A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    RULE_121_4_DRAW_FROM_EMPTY_LIBRARY_IS_GAME_LOSS,
    
    // 121.5. If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty.
    RULE_121_5_MOVE_TO_HAND_IS_NOT_A_DRAW,
    
    // 122.1. A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Counters are not objects and have no characteristics. Notably, a counter is not a token, and a token is not a counter. Counters with the same name or description are interchangeable.
    RULE_122_1_COUNTER_DEFINITION,
    
    // 122.1a. A +X/+Y counter on a creature or on a creature card in a zone other than the battlefield, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that object’s power and Y to that object’s toughness. Similarly, -X/-Y counters subtract from power and toughness. See rule 613.4c.
    RULE_122_1a_STAT_COUNTERS_MODIFY_PT,
    
    // 122.2. Counters on an object are not retained if that object moves from one zone to another. The counters are not “removed”; they simply cease to exist. See rule 400.7.
    RULE_122_2_COUNTERS_CEASE_TO_EXIST_ON_ZONE_CHANGE,
    
    // 122.3. If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it as a state-based action, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it. See rule 704.
    RULE_122_3_PLUS_AND_MINUS_COUNTERS_CANCEL,

    // Covers the following rules:
    // 123.1. A sticker is a marker placed on an object that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Stickers are not objects. Notably, a sticker is not a counter or a token. Changes to an object from stickers are not part of its copiable values. There are four kinds of stickers: name stickers; ability stickers; power and toughness stickers; and art stickers.
    // 123.2. Stickers are found in boosters of the Unfinity expansion on numbered inserts. Each insert has a predetermined combination of stickers. Any rule that refers to a sticker sheet refers to the specific combination of stickers found on one of those inserts. Sticker sheets are not cards and have no characteristics. Each sticker sheet can be found at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
    // 123.2a. In constructed play, a player who chooses to play with stickers must start the game with at least ten sticker sheets selected before play begins, and each of their sticker sheets must be unique. There is no maximum number of sticker sheets a player may start the game with. Each player playing with sticker sheets reveals all of their sticker sheets and chooses three of them at random. See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”
    // 123.2b. In limited play, each player chooses up to three sticker sheets from among those in the sealed products they opened and reveals them. See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”
    // 123.2c. Each player has access to only the stickers on the chosen sheets during the game, and those sticker sheets remain revealed.
    // 123.3. If an effect instructs a player to put a sticker on an object, that player chooses a sticker that is not currently on any objects they own from among the stickers they have access to and puts it on that object.
    // 123.3a. Each sticker a player has access to is discrete and is distinct from each other sticker they have access to. Two stickers are never considered to be the same sticker, even if they have the same text or information on them.
    // 123.3b. A player can’t put a sticker on an object that they don’t own. If an effect would cause them to do so, that part of the effect does nothing.
    // 123.3c. A sticker may have a ticket cost represented by a number inside a ticket symbol (see rule 107.17a). In order to put a sticker with a ticket cost on an object, the player who owns that object must pay that much {TK}. If they don’t have that much {TK}, they can’t put that sticker on an object.
    // 123.3d. If a sticker that is already on an object is moved to another object, that sticker’s ticket cost does not need to be paid again.
    // 123.4. Some rules and effects refer to a “stickered” object. An object is “stickered” if it currently has any kind of sticker on it. An object without any stickers on it is not a stickered object, even if it previously had stickers on it.
    // 123.5. Stickers on an object are not retained as that object moves to a hidden zone. Stickers are retained as that object moves to a public zone and continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone; this is an exception to rule 400.7.
    // 123.5a. If one or more cards with stickers on them enter the battlefield as part of a melded permanent, all of those stickers are on the permanent that object becomes on the battlefield. They maintain their relative timestamp order.
    // 123.5b. If an object with a sticker on it becomes a component of a merged permanent on the battlefield, that sticker is on that merged permanent.
    // 123.5c. If a melded or merged permanent with one or more stickers on it moves from the battlefield to another public zone, only one of the objects it becomes will retain those stickers. Its owner chooses which of the objects it becomes in its new zone retains any stickers that are on it. Effects from those stickers will continue to apply to only that object.
    // 123.6. A name sticker consists only of one or more words. A name sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes the word on that sticker to be added to the text of that object’s name. This is a text-changing effect. See rule 613.1c and rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects.”
    // 123.6a. For the purposes of rules and effects related to name stickers, a “word” in an object’s name is any series of non-space characters that are separated from other non-space characters by one or more spaces. Hyphenated words and words with punctuation are considered to be one word. Blank lines, such as the one in “Wolf in ________ Clothing,” are not considered words in a card’s name.
    // 123.6b. As a name sticker is placed on an object, that object’s controller chooses a position in that object’s name for the word in the name sticker to be added, then announces that object’s new name. That word can be added at the beginning of the object’s name or after any number of the other words that are currently in its name. The new name can be further modified by other name stickers. If that object has no name, its name becomes the word added by the name sticker. Name stickers never modify or remove any of the other words in that name.
    // 123.6c. The text that a name sticker is modifying may change due to other effects and/or a permanent’s face-down status (see rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents”). To determine the name of an object with one or more name stickers, start with the object’s copiable values, then apply each name sticker’s effect and each other text-changing effect in timestamp order. The position of each name sticker will continue to be after the number of words that were before it in the object’s name when it was placed. If there are fewer words in the object’s current name, the word on that sticker is added at the end of its name instead. The position and timestamp order of each name sticker on an object is remembered as the object that sticker is on moves from one public zone to another, and it continues to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone (see rule 123.5). This is an exception to rule 400.7.
    // 123.6d. Some effects refer to the number of one or more specific letters on a name sticker. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
    // 123.6e. Some effects refer to the number of “unique vowels” on a name sticker. These count the number of different vowels that appear on that sticker, even if one or more of them appear more than once. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
    // 123.7. An ability sticker is a sticker with one or more abilities printed on it. An ability sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object to gain the ability that is printed on that sticker. See rule 613.1f.
    // 123.7a. If an effect refers to an ability of an ability sticker, it refers to the ability that sticker grants to the object it is on, even if the object it is on doesn’t currently have that ability due to another effect.
    // 123.8. A power and toughness sticker is a sticker that has two numbers and a slash printed on it, resembling the power and toughness of a creature card. A power and toughness sticker on a creature or on a creature or Vehicle card in a zone other than the battlefield sets that object’s power and toughness to the values printed on that sticker (see rule 613.4b). If more than one power and toughness sticker is on a creature, use timestamp order to determine which one takes precedence (see rule 613.7).
    // 123.8a. An effect that refers to the power and/or toughness of a sticker refers only to the printed power and/or toughness values on a power and toughness sticker. It does not refer to any printed value on any other stickers.
    // 123.9. An art sticker on a permanent has no effect on game play other than to act as a marker that other spells and abilities can identify.
    // 717.1. Attraction is an artifact subtype seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Each Attraction has an “Astrotorium” card back rather than a traditional Magic card back and has a column of circled numbers on the right side of its text box. Numbers in white text on a brightly colored background are said to be “lit up” on those cards. Note that multiple Attraction cards with the same English name may have different numbers lit up. You can see each Attraction card’s possible combinations of lights at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
    // 717.2. Attraction cards do not begin the game in a player’s deck and do not count toward maximum or minimum deck sizes. Rather, a player who chooses to play with Attraction cards begins the game with a supplementary Attraction deck that exists in the command zone. Each Attraction deck is shuffled before the game begins (see rule 103.3a).
    // 717.2a. In constructed play, an Attraction deck must contain at least ten Attraction cards and each card in an Attraction deck must have a different English name.
    // 717.2b. In limited play, an Attraction deck must contain at least three Attraction cards from that player’s card pool, and may contain multiple Attractions cards with the same English name.
    // 717.3. Effects can cause an Attraction card to enter the battlefield from the command zone. See rule 701.51, “Open an Attraction.”
    // 717.4. As a player’s precombat main phase begins, a player who controls one or more Attractions rolls to visit their Attractions. See rules 703.4g and 701.52, “Roll to Visit Your Attractions.” This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
    // 717.5. Each Attraction card has an ability that begins with the word “Visit” followed by a long dash in its rules text. This is a visit ability. A visit ability triggers whenever you roll to visit your Attractions and the result matches one of the lit-up numbers. See rule 702.159, “Visit.”
    // 717.6. If a card with an Astrotorium card back would be put into a zone other than the battlefield, exile, or the command zone from anywhere, instead its owner puts it into the command zone. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.
    // 717.6a. Each card owned by the same player that has been put in the command zone this way is kept in a single face-up pile separate from any player’s Attraction deck. This pile is informally referred to as that player’s “junkyard.” The pile is not its own zone.
    ESOTERIC_CARD_ATTRIBUTES,

    // Placeholder for Card Types
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 311.1. Plane is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses plane cards. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    // 311.2. Plane cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a plane card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 311.3. Plane subtypes are listed after a long dash, and may be multiple words: “Plane — Serra’s Realm.” All words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype. Planar subtypes are called planar types. A plane can have only one subtype. See rule 205.3n for the complete list of planar types.
    // 311.4. A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a plane card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 311.5. The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 311.6. A face-up plane card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 311.7. Each plane card has a triggered ability that triggers “Whenever chaos ensues.” These are called chaos abilities. Each one is indicated by a chaos symbol to the left of the ability, though the symbol itself has no special rules meaning. This ability triggers if the chaos symbol is rolled on the planar die (see rule 901.9b), if a resolving spell or ability says that chaos ensues, or if a resolving spell or ability states that chaos ensues for a particular object. In the last case, the chaos ability can trigger even if that plane card is still in the planar deck but revealed. A chaos ability is controlled by the current planar controller.
    // 312.1. Phenomenon is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses phenomenon cards. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    // 312.2. Phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a phenomenon card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 312.3. Phenomenon cards have no subtypes.
    // 312.4. The controller of a face-up phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 312.5. Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you encounter it. “When you encounter [this phenomenon]” means “When you move this card off a planar deck and turn it face up.”
    // 312.6. A face-up phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 312.7. If a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isn’t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action; see rule 704. See also rule 701.31, “Planeswalk.”)
    // 313.1. Vanguard is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Vanguard casual variant uses vanguard cards. See rule 902, “Vanguard.”
    // 313.2. Vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 313.3. Vanguard cards have no subtypes.
    // 313.4. A vanguard card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a vanguard card is in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 313.5. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
    // 313.6. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied to the starting hand size and maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner (normally seven). The resulting number is both how many cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and their maximum hand size. See rule 103.5.
    // 313.7. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard card’s owner (normally 20) to is determined. See rule 103.4.
    // 314.1. Scheme is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Archenemy casual variant uses scheme cards. See rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    // 314.2. Scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a scheme deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a scheme card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 314.3. Scheme cards have no subtypes.
    // 314.4. A scheme card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a scheme card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 314.5. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
    // 314.6. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 314.7. If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the command zone that’s the source of that ability. This is an exception to rule 109.2.
    // 315.1. Conspiracy cards are used only in limited play, particularly in the Conspiracy Draft variant (see rule 905). Conspiracy cards aren’t used in constructed play.
    // 315.2. At the start of a game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. (See rule 702.106, “Hidden Agenda.”)
    // 315.3. Conspiracy cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast or included in a deck. If a conspiracy card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone. Conspiracy cards that aren’t in the game can’t be brought into the game.
    // 315.4. Conspiracy cards have no subtypes.
    // 315.5. Conspiracy cards may have any number of static or triggered abilities. As long as a conspiracy card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, and its triggered abilities may trigger.
    // 315.5a. Abilities of conspiracy cards may affect the start-of-game procedure.
    // 315.5b. Face-down conspiracy cards have no characteristics.
    // 315.6. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
    // 315.7. At any time, you may look at a face-down conspiracy card you control. You can’t look at face-down conspiracy cards controlled by other players.
    ESOTERIC_CARD_TYPES,

    // Placeholder for Special Actions
    // Covers the following rules:
    ESOTERIC_SPECIAL_ACTIONS,

    // Placeholder for Mechanics
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 719.1. Each Case card’s illustration is vertically oriented on the left side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.
    // 719.2. The Case frame has no additional rules meaning.
    // 719.3. Case cards have two special keyword abilities that appear before a long dash and represent a triggered ability and an ability that may be static, triggered, or activated.
    // 719.3a. “To solve — [Condition]” means “At the beginning of your end step, if [condition] and this Case is not solved, this Case becomes solved.”
    // 719.3b. Solved is a designation a permanent can have. It has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that spells and abilities can identify. Once a permanent becomes solved, it stays solved until it leaves the battlefield. The solved designation is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 719.3c. If a Case has the solved designation, “Solved — [Ability text]” is an ability that may affect the game if it’s a static ability, it may trigger if it’s a triggered ability, and it can be activated if it’s an activated ability. See rule 702.169, “Solved.”
    // 720.1. Omen cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
    // 720.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.
    // 720.2a. If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that “has an Omen,” it refers to an object that has the alternative characteristics of an Omen spell, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.
    // 720.2b. The existence and values of these alternative characteristics are part of the object’s copiable values.
    // 720.2c. Although omen cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each omen card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an omen card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
    // 720.3. As a player casts an omen card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Omen.
    // 720.3a. When casting an omen card as an Omen, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to see if it can be cast.
    // 720.3b. While on the stack as an Omen, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.
    // 720.3c. If an Omen spell is copied, the copy is also an Omen. It has the alternative characteristics of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Omen spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as an Omen refers to the copy as well.
    // 720.3d. As an Omen spell resolves, its controller shuffles it into its owner’s library instead of putting it into its owner’s graveyard as it resolves.
    // 720.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Omen, an omen card has only its normal characteristics.
    // 720.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an omen card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
    // 721.1. Each station card has a striated text box and may have one or more power/toughness boxes. The text box of a station card contains one or two station symbols. Station cards also usually have the station keyword ability (see rule 702.184).
    // 721.2. A station symbol represents a static ability. The station symbol includes a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “{N+}.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a station symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of any power and toughness boxes printed within that striation, indicated here as [P/T].
    // 721.2a. “{N+}[abilities]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities].”
    // 721.2b. “{N+}[abilities][P/T]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities] and is a creature with base power and toughness [P/T] in addition to its other types.”
    // 721.2c. While in any zone other than the battlefield, station cards do not have power or toughness.
    // 721.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which station symbol. Station cards each contain only one text box.
    // 721.4. Any ability a station card has that isn’t preceded by a station symbol is treated normally. In particular, each station card has its station ability (see rule 702.184) at all times. That ability may be activated regardless of how many charge counters are on it.
    // 722.1. Preparation cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
    // 722.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the right defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the left.
    // 722.2a. The inset frame of a preparation card is called a “prepare spell.” If a rule or effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that has a prepare spell, it refers to an object for which these alternative characteristics exist, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.
    // 722.2b. The existence and values of these alternative characteristics are part of the object’s copiable values.
    // 722.2c. Although preparation cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each preparation card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a preparation card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
    // 722.3. Preparation cards can’t be cast using the alternative characteristics found within their inset frames. Rather, these characteristics are used to define characteristics of copies which may be cast.
    // 722.3a. Some spells and abilities cause a permanent with a prepare spell to become prepared or state that a permanent enters prepared. If that permanent has the alternative characteristics of a prepare spell, this gives the permanent the “prepared” designation. Prepared is a designation that acts as a marker which rules and effects can identify. A permanent can’t gain this designation unless it has a prepare spell, Additionally, a permanent can’t gain this designation if the permanent already has it.
    // 722.3b. A rule or effect may cause a permanent to become “unprepared.” This removes the prepared designation from that permanent.
    // 722.3c. As a permanent with a prepare spell gains the prepared designation or phases in prepared, its controller creates a copy of that object in exile, except that copy has only the characteristics of that permanent’s prepare spell, ignoring other exceptions to the copying process that apply to that permanent. Those characteristics become the copy’s normal characteristics. This copy remains in exile for as long as the prepared permanent remains on the battlefield and has the prepared designation. This is an exception to rule 704.5e. For as long as the copy remains in exile, the prepared permanent’s controller may cast the copy. That permanent loses the prepared designation at the time the spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i).
    // 722.3d. If a prepare spell is copied, the copy is also a prepare spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as a prepare spell refers to the copy as well.
    // 722.4. In every zone, a preparation card has only its normal characteristics.
    // 722.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a preparation card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
    // 728.1. Rad counters are a kind of counter a player can have (see rule 122, “Counters”). There is an inherent triggered ability associated with rad counters. This ability has no source and is controlled by the active player. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full text of this ability is “At the beginning of each player’s precombat main phase, if that player has one or more rad counters, that player mills a number of cards equal to the number of rad counters they have. For each nonland card milled this way, that player loses 1 life and removes one rad counter from themselves.”
    // 728.1a. A card that refers to life loss “from radiation” refers to life lost as a result of the triggered ability associated with rad counters.
    ESOTERIC_MECHANICS,

    // Placeholder for Multiplayer Variants
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.
    // 807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.
    // 807.2a. Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).
    // 807.2b. The attack left option is used (see rule 803).
    // 807.2c. The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren’t used in the Grand Melee variant.
    // 807.3. The players are seated at random.
    // 807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.
    // 807.4a. There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.
    // 807.4b. The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player’s left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time.
    // 807.4c. After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately.
    // 807.4d. A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.
    // 807.4e. If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.
    // 807.4f. For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.
    // 807.4g. If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who’s not taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one.
    // 807.4h. If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats don’t enter one another’s range of influence until the next turn begins.
    // 807.4i. If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.
    // 807.4j. If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.
    // 807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.
    // 807.5a. A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.
    // 807.5b. If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can’t target objects on multiple stacks.
    // 809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.
    // 809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which it’s seated. Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals whose job is to protect the emperor.
    // 809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.
    // 809.3a. The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”
    // 809.3b. Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).
    // 809.3c. A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them, a planeswalker controlled by a player seated immediately next to them, or a battle protected by a player seated immediately next to them.
    // 809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.
    // 809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
    // 809.5a. A team wins the game if its emperor wins.
    // 809.5b. A team loses the game if its emperor loses.
    // 809.5c. The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor.
    // 809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.
    // 809.6a. Each general’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperor’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of another emperor.
    // 809.7. In the Emperor variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
    // 811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.
    // 811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.
    // 811.2a. The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”
    // 811.2b. Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”
    // 811.2c. The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.
    // 811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.
    // 811.4. A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them, planeswalkers that aren’t controlled by opponents seated next to them, or battles that aren’t protected by opponents seated next to them.
    // 811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates can’t review each other’s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
    ESOTERIC_MULTIPLAYER_VARIANTS,

    // Placeholder for Casual Variants
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
    // 901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a supplementary planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 311, “Planes,” and rule 312, “Phenomena.”)
    // 901.3a. A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol. One face has the chaos symbol. The other faces are blank.
    // 901.4. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up.
    // 901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.7.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.
    // 901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 901.7a. A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the “planeswalking ability.” The full text of this ability is “Whenever you roll the Planeswalker symbol on the planar die, planeswalk.” (See rule 701.31, “Planeswalk.”) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule 113.8.
    // 901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn’t use the stack. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 116.2i.)
    // 901.9a. If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.
    // 901.9b. If the die roll is the chaos symbol, chaos ensues (see rule 311.7). The active player gets priority.
    // 901.9c. If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol, the “planeswalking ability” triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule 901.8.)
    // 901.9d. Rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See 706, “Rolling a Die.”
    // 901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.
    // 901.10a. If a plane leaves the game while a “planeswalking ability” is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.
    // 901.10b. Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.
    // 901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has “planeswalked.” Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.31.
    // 901.11a. A player may planeswalk as the result of the “planeswalking ability” (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon’s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.
    // 901.11b. The plane card that’s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.
    // 901.11c. If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.
    // 901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.
    // 901.12a. Each player has their own planar deck.
    // 901.12b. The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller’s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller’s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.
    // 901.12c. Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to “you” applies to both members of the planar controller’s team.
    // 901.12d. Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player’s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.
    // 901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”)
    // 901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.
    // 901.14a. Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule 901.5). Each of them is a planar controller.
    // 901.14b. If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.
    // 901.15. Single Planar Deck Option
    // 901.15a. As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can’t contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.
    // 901.15b. In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck.
    // 901.15c. If any rule or ability refers to a player’s planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.
    // 902.1. In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 902.2. A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
    // 902.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner’s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.
    // 902.4. Each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.5. Each player’s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.5a. If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand equal to their starting hand size. (In a multiplayer game, a player’s first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule 103.5.
    // 902.5b. A player’s maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.6. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
    // 902.7. Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 904.1. In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 904.2. The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule 808) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) and the shared team turns option (see rule 805) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.
    // 904.2a. One of the teams consists of exactly one player, who is designated the archenemy.
    // 904.2b. The other team consists of any number of players.
    // 904.3. In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a supplementary scheme deck of at least twenty scheme cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule 314, “Schemes.”)
    // 904.4. All scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a scheme deck and while they’re face up.
    // 904.5. The archenemy’s starting life total is 40. Each other player’s starting life total is 20.
    // 904.6. Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.
    // 904.7. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
    // 904.8. Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 904.9. Immediately after the archenemy’s precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called “setting that scheme in motion.” (See rule 701.32.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger “When you set this scheme in motion” trigger.
    // 904.10. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 904.11. Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability causes it to be abandoned (see rule 701.33).
    // 904.12. Supervillain Rumble Option
    // 904.12a. As an alternative option, players may play a Free-for-All game in which each player has their own scheme deck. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) is used; no other multiplayer options are used.
    // 904.12b. Each player in this game is an archenemy.
    // 904.12c. As in a normal Free-for-All game, the starting player is randomly determined. All other rules that apply to the archenemy in an Archenemy game apply to each player in a Supervillain Rumble game.
    // 904.13. Archenemy Commander Option
    // 904.13a. As an alternative option, players may play a Commander game (see rule 903, “Commander”) using the Archenemy rules. The normal rules for Commander apply, as modified by the Archenemy rules, with the following exceptions.
    // 904.13b. The archenemy starts with 60 life. The opposing team has a shared life total that starts at 60 life rather than individual life totals. The use of a shared life total is detailed in rules 810.8 and 810.9 of the Two-Headed Giant variant.
    // 904.13c. Poison counters are not shared. If the archenemy has ten or more poison counters, they lose the game. If any individual member of the opposing team has ten or more poison counters, they lose the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 904.13d. The archenemy’s scheme deck must contain at least ten cards, and each card must have a different English name.
    // 905.1. The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant uses Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy® and/or Conspiracy: Take the Crown booster packs by default.
    // 905.1a. A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.
    // 905.1b. In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.
    // 905.1c. During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from, cards they have already drafted, cards that are currently revealed as described in rule 905.2b, and cards that have been drafted face up as described in rule 905.2c. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.
    // 905.1d. After the draft and all actions that may be taken during or after the draft, all the cards a player has drafted become that player’s card pool. The player builds their deck from only these cards and any number of basic land cards. See rules 100.2b and 100.4b.
    // 905.2. Some cards have abilities that function during the draft.
    // 905.2a. During a draft, there is no active player or system of priority. If multiple players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft and can’t agree on an order, those actions are taken in a random order.
    // 905.2b. Some cards instruct players to reveal them as they’re drafted and then note some information, such as a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game. Any player can look at this information at any time during the draft or game. After the information is noted, the drafted card is turned face down and added to the player’s drafted cards pile.
    // 905.2c. Some cards instruct players to draft them face up. Each such card remains face up until the draft is complete, an effect instructs the player who drafted it to turn it face down, or the card leaves that player’s drafted cards pile. While the card is face up, all players may look at it.
    // 905.3. A Conspiracy Draft game is a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
    // 905.4. At the start of the game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone.
    // 905.4a. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. Any time a player has priority, they may turn a face-down conspiracy card they control face up. See rule 702.106, “Hidden Agenda.”
    // 905.5. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
    // 905.6. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.
    ESOTERIC_CASUAL_VARIANTS,

    // --- 1. Game Concepts ---

    // 100.1. These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.
    // 100.1a. A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.
    // 100.1b. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 8, “Multiplayer Rules.”
    RULE_100_1_MAGIC_APPLY_GAME_PLAYERS_INCLUDING,

    // 100.2. To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.
    // 100.2a. In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each deck has a minimum deck size of 60 cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule 201.3).
    // 100.2b. In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic product such as booster packs and creates their own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each deck has a minimum deck size of 40 cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.
    // 100.2c. Commander decks are subject to additional deckbuilding restrictions and requirements. See rule 903, “Commander,” for details.
    // 100.2d. Some formats and casual play variants allow players to use a supplementary deck of nontraditional Magic cards (see rule 108.2a). These supplementary decks have their own deck construction rules. See rule 717, “Attraction Cards;” rule 901, “Planechase;” and rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    RULE_100_2_PLAY_PLAYER_NEEDS_OWN_DECK,

    // 100.3. Some cards require coins or traditional dice. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic cards, and specialized dice.
    RULE_100_3_CARDS_REQUIRE_COINS_TRADITIONAL_DICE,

    // 100.4. Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match. Sideboard rules and restrictions for some formats are modified by the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
    // 100.4a. In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule 100.2a) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.
    // 100.4b. In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player’s card pool not included in their deck are in that player’s sideboard.
    // 100.4c. In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards in a team’s card pool but not in either player’s deck are in that team’s sideboard.
    // 100.4d. In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a team’s card pool but not in any player’s deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has their own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.
    RULE_100_4_CONSTRUCTED_PLAY_SIDEBOARD_CONTAIN_THAN,

    // 100.5. If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.
    RULE_100_5_DECK_CONTAIN_NUMBER_CARDS_MINIMUM(Condition),

    // 100.6. Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.
    // 100.6a. Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.
    // 100.6b. Players can use the Magic Store & Event Locator at Locator.Wizards.com to find tournaments in their area.
    RULE_100_6_MAGIC_TOURNAMENTS_ORGANIZED_PLAY_ACTIVITIES(Condition),

    // 100.7. Certain cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that aren’t covered by these rules. These include Mystery Booster playtest cards, promotional cards and cards in “Un-sets” that were printed with a silver border, and cards in the Unfinity™ expansion that have an acorn symbol at the bottom of the card.
    RULE_100_7_CARDS_INTENDED_CASUAL_PLAY_FEATURES(Condition),

    // 102.1. A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.
    RULE_102_1_PLAYER_PEOPLE_GAME_ACTIVE_TURN,

    // 102.2. In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.
    RULE_102_2_PLAYER_GAME_OPPONENT,

    // 102.3. In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on their team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on their team.
    RULE_102_3_MULTIPLAYER_GAME_TEAMS_PLAYERS_TEAMMATES,

    // 102.4. A spell or ability may use the term “your team” as shorthand for “you and/or your teammates.” In a game that isn’t a multiplayer game between teams, “your team” means the same thing as “you.”
    RULE_102_4_SPELL_ABILITY_TERM_TEAM_SHORTHAND,

    // 103.1. At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.
    // 103.1a. In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.
    // 103.1b. In an Archenemy game, these methods aren’t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the archenemy takes the first turn.
    // 103.1c. One card (Power Play) states that its controller is the starting player. This effect applies after this determination has happened and supersedes these methods.
    RULE_103_1_START_GAME_PLAYERS_CHOOSE_TURN(Condition),

    // 103.2. Some games require additional steps that are taken after the starting player has been determined. Perform the actions listed in 103.2a–e in order, as applicable.
    // 103.2a. If any players are using sideboards (see rule 100.4) or cards being represented by substitute cards (see rule 713), those cards are set aside. After this happens, each player’s deck is considered their starting deck.
    // 103.2b. If any players wish to reveal a card with a companion ability that they own from outside the game, they may do so. A player may reveal no more than one card this way, and they may do so only if their deck fulfills the condition of that card’s companion ability. The revealed card remains outside the game. (See rule 702.139, “Companion.”)
    // 103.2c. In a Commander game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. See rule 903.6.
    // 103.2d. In a constructed game, each player playing with sticker sheets reveals all of their sticker sheets and chooses three of them at random. In a limited game, each player chooses up to three sticker sheets from among those in the sealed product they opened and reveals them. In either case, that player has access to only the stickers on the chosen sheets during the game, and those sticker sheets remain revealed. (See rule 123, “Stickers.”)
    // 103.2e. In a Conspiracy Draft game, each player puts any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone. See rule 905.4.
    RULE_103_2_GAMES_REQUIRE_ADDITIONAL_STEPS_STARTING(Condition),

    // 103.3. After the starting player has been determined and any additional steps performed, each player shuffles their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents’ decks. The players’ decks become their libraries.
    // 103.3a. In a game using one or more supplementary decks of nontraditional cards (see rule 100.2d), each supplementary deck’s owner shuffles it so the cards are in a random order. Each player may then shuffle or cut their opponents’ supplementary decks.
    RULE_103_3_STARTING_PLAYER_ADDITIONAL_STEPS_PERFORMED,

    // 103.4. Each player begins the game with a starting life total of 20. Some variant games have different starting life totals.
    // 103.4a. In a Two-Headed Giant game, each team’s starting life total is 30.
    // 103.4b. In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 103.4c. In a Commander game, each player’s starting life total is 40.
    // 103.4d. In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 30.
    // 103.4e. In an Archenemy game, the archenemy’s starting life total is 40.
    RULE_103_4_PLAYER_BEGINS_GAME_STARTING_LIFE,

    // 103.5. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player’s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans.
    // 103.5a. In a Vanguard game, each player’s starting hand size is seven plus or minus the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 103.5b. If an effect allows a player to perform an action “any time [that player] could mulligan,” the player may perform that action at a time they would declare whether they will take a mulligan. This need not be in the first round of mulligans. Other players may have already made their mulligan declarations by the time the player has the option to perform this action. If the player performs the action, they then declare whether they will take a mulligan.
    // 103.5c. In a multiplayer game and in any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
    // 103.5d. In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, first each player on the starting team declares whether that player will take a mulligan, then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand.
    RULE_103_5_VANGUARD_GAME_PLAYERS_STARTING_HAND(Condition),

    // 103.7. In a Planechase game, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane. (See rule 901, “Planechase.”)
    RULE_103_7_PLANECHASE_GAME_STARTING_PLAYER_MOVES(Condition),

    // 104.4. There are several ways for the game to be a draw.
    // 104.4a. If all the players remaining in a game lose simultaneously, the game is a draw.
    // 104.4b. If a game that’s not using the limited range of influence option (including a two-player game) somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw. Loops that contain an optional action don’t result in a draw.
    // 104.4c. An effect may state that the game is a draw.
    // 104.4d. In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw if all remaining teams lose simultaneously.
    // 104.4e. In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, the effect of a spell or ability that states that the game is a draw causes the game to be a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and all players within their range of influence. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all other players.
    // 104.4f. In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, if the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. Only those players leave the game; the game continues for all other players.
    // 104.4g. In a multiplayer game between teams, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for all remaining players on that team.
    // 104.4h. In the Emperor variant, the game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor. (See rule 809.5.)
    // 104.4i. In a tournament, all players in the game may agree to an intentional draw. See rule 100.6.
    RULE_104_4_SEVERAL_WAYS_GAME_DRAW(Condition),

    // 105.1. There are five colors in the Magic game: white, blue, black, red, and green.
    RULE_105_1_FIVE_COLORS_IN_MAGIC,

    // 105.2. An object can be one or more of the five colors, or it can be no color at all. An object is the color or colors of the mana symbols in its mana cost, regardless of the color of its frame. An object’s color or colors may also be defined by a color indicator or a characteristic-defining ability. See rule 202.2.
    RULE_105_2_OBJECT_COLORS_OR_COLORLESS(Condition),

    // 105.2a. A monocolored object is exactly one of the five colors.
    RULE_105_2a_MONOCOLORED_OBJECT,

    // 105.2b. A multicolored object is two or more of the five colors.
    RULE_105_2b_MULTICOLORED_OBJECT,

    // 105.2c. A colorless object has no color.
    RULE_105_2c_COLORLESS_OBJECT,

    // 105.3. Effects may change an object’s color or give a color to a colorless object. If an effect gives an object a new color, the new color replaces all previous colors the object had (unless the effect said the object became that color “in addition” to its other colors). Effects may also make a colored object become colorless.
    RULE_105_3_EFFECTS_CHANGE_OBJECTS_COLOR_COLORLESS(Condition),

    // 106.1. Mana is the primary resource in the game. Players spend mana to pay costs, usually when casting spells and activating abilities.
    // 106.1a. There are five colors of mana: white, blue, black, red, and green.
    // 106.1b. There are six types of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
    RULE_106_1_MANA_PRIMARY_RESOURCE_GAME_PLAYERS(Condition),

    // 106.2. Mana is represented by mana symbols (see rule 107.4). Mana symbols also represent mana costs (see rule 202).
    RULE_106_2_MANA_SYMBOLS_COSTS,

    // 107.4. The mana symbols are {W}, {U}, {B}, {R}, {G}, and {C}; the numerical symbols {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, and so on; the variable symbol {X}; the hybrid symbols {W/U}, {W/B}, {U/B}, {U/R}, {B/R}, {B/G}, {R/G}, {R/W}, {G/W}, and {G/U}; the monocolored hybrid symbols {2/W}, {2/U}, {2/B}, {2/R}, {2/G}, {C/W}, {C/U}, {C/B}, {C/R}, and {C/G}; the Phyrexian mana symbols {W/P}, {U/P}, {B/P}, {R/P}, and {G/P}; the hybrid Phyrexian symbols {W/U/P}, {W/B/P}, {U/B/P}, {U/R/P}, {B/R/P}, {B/G/P}, {R/G/P}, {R/W/P}, {G/W/P}, and {G/U/P}; and the snow mana symbol {S}.
    RULE_107_4_MANA_SYMBOLS_W_U_B,

    // 107.4a. There are five primary colored mana symbols: {W} is white, {U} blue, {B} black, {R} red, and {G} green. These symbols are used to represent colored mana, and also to represent colored mana in costs. Colored mana in costs can be paid only with the appropriate color of mana. See rule 202, “Mana Cost and Color.”
    RULE_107_4a_PRIMARY_COLORED_MANA_SYMBOLS_W,

    // 107.4g. In rules text, the Phyrexian symbol {H} with no colored background means any of the fifteen Phyrexian mana symbols.
    RULE_107_4g_TEXT_PHYREXIAN_SYMBOL_H_COLORED,

    // 107.9. A tombstone icon appears to the left of the name of many Odyssey™ block cards with abilities that are relevant in a player’s graveyard. The purpose of the icon is to make those cards stand out when they’re in a graveyard. This icon has no effect on game play.
    RULE_107_9_TOMBSTONE_ICON_APPEARS_LEFT_NAME(Condition),

    // 107.10. A type icon appears in the upper left corner of each card from the Future Sight™ set printed with an alternate “timeshifted” frame. If the card has a single card type, this icon indicates what it is: claw marks for creature, a flame for sorcery, a lightning bolt for instant, a sunrise for enchantment, a chalice for artifact, and a pair of mountain peaks for land. If the card has multiple card types, that’s indicated by a black and white cross. This icon has no effect on game play.
    RULE_107_10_TYPE_ICON_APPEARS_UPPER_LEFT(Condition),

    // 107.11. The Planeswalker symbol is {PW}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant. It has five tines at the top and tapers to a point at the bottom. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_107_11_PLANESWALKER_SYMBOL_PW_APPEARS_FACE(Condition),

    // 107.12. The chaos symbol is {CHAOS}. It appears on one face of the planar die used in the Planechase casual variant, as well as in abilities that refer to the results of rolling the planar die. It looks like a swirling vortex. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_107_12_CHAOS_SYMBOL_APPEARS_FACE_PLANAR,

    // 107.13. A color indicator is a circular symbol that appears to the left of the type line on some cards. The color of the symbol defines the card’s color or colors. See rule 202, “Mana Cost and Color.”
    RULE_107_13_COLOR_INDICATOR_CIRCULAR_SYMBOL_APPEARS,

    // 108.1. Use the Oracle card reference when determining a card’s wording. A card’s Oracle text can be found using the Gatherer card database at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
    RULE_108_1_CARD_REFERENCE_WORDING_TEXT_COM(Condition),

    // 108.2. When a rule or text on a card refers to a “card,” it means only a Magic card or an object represented by a Magic card.
    // 108.2a. Most Magic games use only traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm). Traditional Magic cards are included in players’ decks. Certain formats also use nontraditional Magic cards. Nontraditional Magic cards are not included in players’ decks. They may be used in supplementary decks. Additionally, they may be oversized, have different card backs, or both.
    // 108.2b. Tokens aren’t considered cards—even a card-sized game supplement that represents a token isn’t considered a card for rules purposes.
    RULE_108_2_TEXT_CARD_MAGIC_OBJECT(Condition),

    // 108.5. Nontraditional Magic cards can’t start the game in any zone other than the command zone (see rule 408). If an effect would bring a nontraditional Magic card other than a dungeon card (see rule 309, “Dungeons”) into the game from outside the game, it doesn’t; that card remains outside the game.
    RULE_108_5_NONTRADITIONAL_MAGIC_CARDS_CANT_START(Condition),

    // 108.6. For more information about cards, see section 2, “Parts of a Card.”
    RULE_108_6_CARDS,

    // 111.7. A token that’s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see rule 704. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)
    RULE_111_7_TOKEN_THATS_ZONE_THAN_BATTLEFIELD(Condition),

    // 111.11. If an effect instructs a player to create a token by name, doesn’t define any other characteristics for that token, and the name is not one of the types in the list of predefined tokens above, that player uses the card with that name in the Oracle card reference to determine the characteristics of that token.
    RULE_111_11_EFFECT_PLAYER_CREATE_TOKEN_NAME(Condition),

    // 111.12. If an effect instructs a player to create a token that is a copy of a nonexistent object, no token is created (see rule 707, “Copying Objects”). This does not apply to an effect that would use the last known information of an object.
    RULE_111_12_EFFECT_PLAYER_CREATE_TOKEN_COPY(Condition),

    // 111.13. A copy of a permanent spell becomes a token as it resolves. The token has the characteristics of the spell that became that token. The token is not “created” for the purposes of any replacement effects or triggered abilities that refer to creating a token.
    RULE_111_13_COPY_PERMANENT_SPELL_BECOMES_TOKEN,

    // 117.6. In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule 805, “Shared Team Turns Option.”
    RULE_117_6_MULTIPLAYER_GAME_SHARED_TEAM_TURNS,

    // 118.4. Some costs include an {X} or an X. See rule 107.3.
    RULE_118_4_COSTS_INCLUDE_X,

    // 118.11. The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don’t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.
    RULE_118_11_ACTIONS_PERFORMED_PAYING_COST_MODIFIED(Condition),

The same is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal the card as it’s being drawn, it’s revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated. While face down, the drawn card is considered to have no characteristics and can’t be used to pay any part of the cost of the spell or ability that would require the card to have specific characteristics.

    // 202.3b. The mana value of the back face of a nonmodal double-faced permanent or spell’s back face is calculated as though it had the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent or spell is a copy of the back face of a nonmodal double-faced object (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the mana value of the copy is 0.
    // 202.3c. The mana value of a melded permanent is calculated as though it had the combined mana cost of the front faces of each card that represents it. If a permanent is a copy of a melded permanent (even if that copy is represented by two other meld cards), the mana value of the copy is 0.
    // 202.3d. The mana value of a split card not on the stack or of a fused split spell on the stack is determined from the combined mana costs of its halves. Otherwise, while a split card is on the stack, the mana value of the spell is determined by the mana cost of the half that was chosen to be cast. See rule 709, “Split Cards.”

    // 205.1a. Some effects set an object’s card type. In most such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card types. However, an object with either the instant or sorcery card type retains that type. Counters, stickers, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an object’s subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types, planeswalker types, or spell types). If an object’s card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are also removed for the entire time the object’s card type is removed. Removing an object’s subtype doesn’t affect its card types at all.

In such cases, all the object’s prior card types, supertypes, and subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use phrases such as “in addition to its other types” or that state that something is “still a [type, supertype, or subtype].” Some effects state that an object becomes an “artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes. Some effects state that an object becomes a “[creature type or types] artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any existing creature types.

Subtypes of creature cards are one or two words and are listed after a long dash. Each word or two-word phrase, as listed in rule 205.3m, is a separate subtype. Objects other than planes may have multiple subtypes. Subtypes of planes are also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype.
    // 205.3c. If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type.
    // 205.3d. An object can’t gain a subtype that doesn’t correspond to one of that object’s types.
    // 205.3e. If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player can’t choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.
    // 205.3f. Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a card’s subtypes are. (See rule 108.1.)

    // 205.3p. One dungeon card (Undercity) has a subtype; this subtype is called a dungeon type. That dungeon type is Undercity.
    // 205.3q. Battles have a unique subtype, called a battle type. That battle type is Siege.
    // 205.3r. Phenomenon cards, scheme cards, vanguard cards, and conspiracy cards have no subtypes.
    RULE_205_3_SUBTYPES_DEFINITION(Condition),

    // 205.4. Supertypes
    // 205.4a. An object can have one or more supertypes. A card’s supertypes are printed directly before its card types. The supertypes are basic, legendary, ongoing, snow, and world.
    // 205.4b. An object’s supertype is independent of its card type and subtype, even though some supertypes are closely identified with specific card types. Changing an object’s card types or subtypes won’t change its supertypes. Changing an object’s supertypes won’t change its card types or subtypes. When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.
    // 205.4c. Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.
    // 205.4d. Any permanent with the supertype “legendary” is subject to the state-based action for legendary permanents, also called the “legend rule” (see rule 704.5j).
    // 205.4e. Any instant or sorcery spell with the supertype “legendary” is subject to a casting restriction. A player can’t cast a legendary instant or sorcery spell unless that player controls a legendary creature or a legendary planeswalker.
    // 205.4f. Any permanent with the supertype “world” is subject to the state-based action for world permanents, also called the “world rule” (see rule 704.5k).
    // 205.4g. Any permanent with the supertype “snow” is a snow permanent. Any permanent that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonsnow permanent, regardless of its name.
    // 205.4h. Any scheme card with the supertype “ongoing” is exempt from the state-based action for schemes (see rule 704.6e).
    RULE_205_4_SUPERTYPES_DEFINITION(Condition),

    // 206.1. The expansion symbol indicates which Magic set a card is from. It’s a small icon normally printed below the right edge of the illustration. It has no effect on game play.
    RULE_206_1_EXPANSION_SYMBOL_INDICATES_MAGIC_SET,

    // 206.2. The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A red-orange symbol indicates the card is mythic rare. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver symbol indicates the card is uncommon. A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple symbol signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time Spiral™ “timeshifted” cards, which were rarer than that set’s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodus™ set, all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didn’t have expansion symbols at all.)
    RULE_206_2_COLOR_EXPANSION_SYMBOL_INDICATES_RARITY(Condition),

    // 206.3. Previously, a spell or ability that affected cards from a particular set checked for that set’s expansion symbol. These cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to say they affect cards “with a name originally printed” in a particular set.
    // 206.3a. One card (City in a Bottle) refers to permanents and cards with a name originally printed in the Arabian Nights™ expansion.

    RULE_206_3_SOME_CARDS_CHECK_SET,

    // 206.4. Players may include cards from any printing in their constructed decks if those cards appear in sets allowed in that format (or those cards are specifically allowed by the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules). See the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for the current definitions of the constructed formats (WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
    RULE_206_4_PLAYERS_INCLUDE_CARDS_FROM_SET_ALLOWED_IN_FORMAT(Condition),

    // 206.5. The full list of expansions and expansion symbols can be found in the Card Set Archive section of the Magic website (Magic.Wizards.com/en/products/card-set-archive).
    RULE_206_5_FULL_LIST_OF_EXPANSION_SYMBOLS,

    // 207.1. The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the card’s abilities.
    RULE_207_1_TEXT_BOX_DEFINITION,

    // 207.2. The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.
    // 207.2a. Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card. It usually appears on the same line as the ability it’s relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.
    // 207.2b. Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game. It usually appears below the rules text.
    // 207.2c. An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Ability words are similar to keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules. The ability words are adamant, addendum, alliance, battalion, bloodrush, celebration, channel, chroma, cohort, constellation, converge, council’s dilemma, coven, delirium, descend 4, descend 8, disappear, domain, eerie, eminence, enrage, fateful hour, fathomless descent, ferocious, flurry, formidable, grandeur, hellbent, heroic, imprint, infusion, inspired, join forces, kinship, landfall, lieutenant, magecraft, metalcraft, morbid, opus, pack tactics, paradox, parley, radiance, raid, rally, renew, repartee, revolt, secret council, spell mastery, strive, survival, sweep, tempting offer, threshold, undergrowth, valiant, vivid, void, and will of the council.
    // 207.2d. Similar to ability words, flavor words appear in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Flavor words provide a flavorful description of abilities, but they have no special rules meaning and are not listed in the Comprehensive Rules. While an ability word ties together several abilities with similar functionality, each flavor word is tailored to the specific ability it appears with.
    RULE_207_2_ITALICIZED_TEXT_HAS_NO_GAME_FUNCTION(Condition),

    // 207.3. Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the text box of most Scars of Mirrodin™ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons. These icons have no effect on game play.
    RULE_207_3_CARDS_DECORATIVE_ICONS_BACKGROUND_TEXT,

    // 207.4. The chaos symbol appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability that triggers whenever chaos ensues. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_207_4_CHAOS_SYMBOL_HAS_NO_MEANING(Condition),

    // 207.5. One card (Cryptic Spires) has a set of symbols below the text box that represent each color and an ability that instructs a player to circle two of those colors as they create their deck. To circle a color, the player circles (or otherwise clearly indicates) that color’s symbol. The mana symbol of each circled color is considered part of that card’s printed rules text (see rule 613.1) and affects that card’s color identity (see rule 903.4).
    RULE_207_5_CRYPTIC_SPIRES_CIRCLES_COLOR_SYMBOLS,

    // 208.1. A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.
    RULE_208_1_CREATURE_CARD_POWER_TOUGHNESS_NUMBERS,

    // 208.2. Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).
    // 208.2a. The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness according to some stated condition. (See rule 604.3.) Such an ability is worded “[This creature’s] [power or toughness] is equal to . . .” or “[This creature’s] power and toughness are each equal to . . .” This ability functions everywhere, even outside the game. If the ability needs to use a number that can’t be determined, including inside a calculation, use 0 instead of that number.
    // 208.2b. The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement effect that sets the creature’s power and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. (See rule 614, “Replacement Effects.”) Such an ability is worded “As [this creature] enters . . . ,” “As [this creature] is turned face up . . . ,” or “[This creature] enters as . . .” and lists two or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional characteristics). The characteristics chosen or determined with these effects affect the creature’s copiable values. (See rule 707.2.) While the card isn’t on the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.
    RULE_208_2_CREATURE_CARD_ALTERNATE_POWER_TOUGHNESS(Condition),

    // 208.3. A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it’s a card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if it has a power and toughness printed on it.
    // 208.3a. If an effect would be created that sets the base power and/or toughness of a noncreature permanent, or otherwise modifies its power and/or toughness, that effect is created even though it doesn’t do anything unless that permanent becomes a creature.
    RULE_208_3_NONCREATURE_PERMANENT_HAS_NO_POWER_TOUGHNESS(Condition),

    // 208.4. Some effects refer to a creature’s “base power,” “base toughness,” or “base power and toughness.”
    // 208.4a. Effects that set a creature’s power and/or toughness to specific values may refer to base power and/or toughness. Other continuous effects may further modify the creature’s power and toughness. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
    // 208.4b. Some effects check a creature’s base power and/or toughness. These effects see that creature’s characteristics after applying any characteristic-defining abilities and abilities that set power and/or toughness, ignoring any effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness without setting them. See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
    RULE_208_4_EFFECTS_CREATURES_BASE_POWER_TOUGHNESS,

    // 208.5. If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.
    RULE_208_5_CREATURE_NO_POWER_VALUE_ZERO(Condition),

    // 209.1. Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its loyalty while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it (see rule 306.5b).
    RULE_209_1_PLANESWALKER_CARD_LOYALTY_NUMBER,

    // 209.2. An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”
    RULE_209_2_ACTIVATED_ABILITY_LOYALTY_SYMBOL_COST(Condition),

    // 210.1. Each battle card has a defense number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its defense while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the battle enters the battlefield with that many defense counters on it (see rule 310.4b).
    RULE_210_1_BATTLE_CARD_DEFENSE_NUMBER_PRINTED,

    // 211.1. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size and the maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner are determined. See rule 103.5.
    RULE_211_1_VANGUARD_CARD_HAND_MODIFIER_PRINTED,

    // 212.1. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard card’s owner is determined. See rule 103.4.
    RULE_212_1_VANGUARD_CARD_LIFE_MODIFIER_PRINTED,

    // 213.1. Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.
    // 213.1a. Most card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total cards in the set] or simply [card number]. Some cards, such as unique cards in Planeswalker Decks®, have card numbers that exceed the listed total number of cards.
    // 213.1b. A card’s rarity is indicated with a single letter following the collector number.
    // 213.1c. Some promotional cards include information to indicate the specific promotion the card is associated with.
    // 213.1d. Some cards with interchangeable names include information about a specific version of a card with that interchangeable name. See rule 201.3.
    // 213.1e. The three-character code representing the set in which a card is printed and the two-character code representing the language in which a card is printed are separated by a bullet point. If a card is premium, these codes are instead separated by a star.
    // 213.1f. The illustration credit for a card follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards, the abbreviation “Illus.”
    // 213.1g. Legal text (the fine print at the bottom or bottom-right of the card) lists the trademark and copyright information.
    RULE_213_1_CARD_CONTAINS_TEXT_NOT_RELEVANT_TO_GAME(Condition),

    // --- 3. Card Types ---

    // 300.1. The card types are artifact, battle, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, kindred, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, and vanguard.
    RULE_300_1_CARD_TYPES_DEFINITION,

    // 300.2. Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of those card types.
    // 300.2a. An object that’s both a land and another card type (for example, an artifact land) can only be played as a land. It can’t be cast as a spell.
    // 300.2b. Each kindred card has another card type. Casting and resolving a kindred card follow the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.
    RULE_300_2_OBJECTS_CAN_HAVE_MULTIPLE_CARD_TYPES,

    // 301.1. A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”)
    RULE_301_1_ARTIFACT_SPELLS_CAST_ON_PRIORITY_AND_EMPTY_STACK(Condition),

    // 301.2. When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
    RULE_301_2_ARTIFACT_SPELL_RESOLVES_ON_BATTLEFIELD(Condition),

    // 301.3. Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Artifact — Equipment.” Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3g for the complete list of artifact types.
    RULE_301_3_ARTIFACT_SUBTYPES_DEFINITION,

    // 301.4. Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than artifact.
    RULE_301_4_ARTIFACT_TYPE_HAVE_NO_SPECIFIC_CHARACTERISTIC,

    // 301.5. Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.
    // 301.5a. The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.
    // 301.5b. Equipment spells are cast like other artifact spells. Equipment enter the battlefield like other artifacts. They don’t enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature you control (see rule 702.6, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.
    // 301.5c. An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature unless that Equipment has reconfigure (see rule 702.151, “Reconfigure”). An Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s controller chooses which creature it equips.
    // 301.5d. An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.
    // 301.5e. If an effect attempts to put an Equipment that isn’t also an Aura (see rule 303.4i) onto the battlefield attached to either an object it can’t legally equip or an object that is undefined, the Equipment enters the battlefield unattached. If the Equipment is a token, it’s created and enters the battlefield unattached.
    // 301.5f. An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.
    RULE_301_5_EQUIPMENT_CONTROL_AND_ATTACHMENT(Condition),

    // 301.6. Some artifacts have the subtype “Fortification.” A Fortification can be attached to a land. It can’t legally be attached to an object that isn’t a land. Fortification’s analog to the equip keyword ability is the fortify keyword ability. Rules 301.5a–f apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule 301.5c: a Fortification that’s also a creature (not a land) can’t fortify a land. (See rule 702.67, “Fortify.”)

    RULE_303_3_ENCHANTMENT_SUBTYPES_SINGLE_WORD_LISTED,

    // 303.4. Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule 702.5, “Enchant”). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.
    // 303.4a. An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by its enchant ability.
    // 303.4b. The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The Aura is attached to, or “enchants,” that object or player.
    // 303.4c. If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left the game, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 303.4d. An Aura can’t enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. An Aura that’s also a creature can’t enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then is put into its owner’s graveyard. (These are state-based actions. See rule 704.) An Aura can’t enchant more than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one object or player, the Aura’s controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to.
    // 303.4e. An Aura’s controller is separate from the enchanted object’s controller or the enchanted player; the two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesn’t change control of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Aura’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura grants an ability to the enchanted object (with “gains” or “has”), the enchanted object’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.
    // 303.4f. If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a player’s control by any means other than by resolving as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesn’t specify the object or player the Aura will enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield. The player must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects.
    // 303.4g. If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object or player for it to enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn’t created.
    // 303.4h. If an effect attempts to put a permanent that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification onto the battlefield attached to an object or player, it enters the battlefield unattached.
    // 303.4i. If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to either an object or player it can’t legally enchant or an object or player that is undefined, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn’t created.
    // 303.4j. If an effect attempts to attach an Aura on the battlefield to an object or player it can’t legally enchant, the Aura doesn’t move.
    // 303.4k. If an effect allows an Aura that’s being turned face up to become attached to an object or player, the Aura’s controller considers the characteristics of that Aura as it would exist if it were face up to determine what it may be attached to, and they must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects.
    // 303.4m. An ability of a permanent that refers to the “enchanted [object or player]” refers to whatever object or player that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Aura.

    // 304.5. If text states that a player may do something “any time they could cast an instant” or “only as an instant,” it means only that the player must have priority. The player doesn’t need to have an instant card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting an instant spell don’t affect the player’s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting an instant spell).
    RULE_304_5_TEXT_STATES_PLAYER_SOMETHING_TIME(Condition),

    // 305.1. A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116). Rather, the player simply puts the land onto the battlefield. Since the land doesn’t go on the stack, it is never a spell, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.
    RULE_305_1_PLAYER_PRIORITY_PLAY_LAND_CARD(Condition),

    // 305.2. A player can normally play one land during their turn; however, continuous effects may increase this number.
    // 305.2a. To determine whether a player can play a land, compare the number of lands the player can play this turn with the number of lands they have already played this turn (including lands played as special actions and lands played during the resolution of spells and abilities). If the number of lands the player can play is greater, the play is legal.
    // 305.2b. A player can’t play a land, for any reason, if the number of lands the player can play this turn is equal to or less than the number of lands they have already played this turn. Ignore any part of an effect that instructs a player to do so.

    RULE_305_4_EFFECTS_ALLOW_PLAYERS_PUT_LANDS,

    // 305.5. Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule 205.3i for the complete list of land types.
    RULE_305_5_LAND_SUBTYPES_SINGLE_WORD_LISTED,

    // 305.6. The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words “basic land type,” it’s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land type has the intrinsic ability “{T}: Add [mana symbol],” even if the text box doesn’t actually contain that text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is {W}; for Islands, {U}; for Swamps, {B}; for Mountains, {R}; and for Forests, {G}. See rule 107.4a. See also rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”
    RULE_305_6_BASIC_LAND_TYPES_PLAINS_ISLAND(Condition),

    // 305.7. If an effect sets a land’s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copiable effects affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesn’t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a land’s subtype doesn’t add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.
    RULE_305_7_EFFECT_SETS_LANDS_SUBTYPE_BASIC(Condition),

    RULE_306_3_PLANESWALKER_SUBTYPES_SINGLE_WORD_LISTED,

    // 306.4. Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a “planeswalker uniqueness rule” that stopped a player from controlling two planeswalkers of the same planeswalker type. This rule has been removed and planeswalker cards printed before this change have received errata in the Oracle card reference to have the legendary supertype. Like other legendary permanents, they are subject to the “legend rule” (see rule 704.5j).

If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only “any time they could cast a sorcery” or “only as a sorcery,” it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of their turn, and the stack must be empty. The player doesn’t need to have a sorcery card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting a sorcery spell don’t affect the player’s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a sorcery spell).
    // 307.5a. Similarly, if an effect checks to see if a spell was cast “any time a sorcery couldn’t have been cast,” it’s checking only whether the spell’s controller cast it without having priority, during a phase other than their main phase, or while another object was on the stack.

    RULE_310_9_BATTLE_CANT_ATTACHED_PLAYERS_PERMANENTS(Condition),

    // 310.10. If a battle that isn’t being attacked has no player designated as its protector, or its protector is a player who can’t be its protector based on its battle type, its controller chooses an appropriate player to be its protector. If no player can be chosen this way, the battle is put into its owner’s graveyard. This is a state-based action (see rule 704).
    RULE_310_10_BATTLE_ISNT_ATTACKED_PLAYER_DESIGNATED(Condition),

    // 310.11. All currently existing battles have the subtype Siege. Sieges are subject to special rules.
    // 310.11a. As a Siege enters the battlefield, its controller must choose its protector from among their opponents. Only an opponent of a Siege’s controller can be its protector.
    // 310.11b. Sieges have the intrinsic ability “When the last defense counter is removed from this permanent, exile it, then you may cast it transformed without paying its mana cost.”

    // --- 4. Zones ---

    // 400.1. A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.
    RULE_400_1_ZONE_PLACE_WHERE_OBJECTS_GAME,

    // 400.2. Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards’ faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cards’ faces. Library and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.
    RULE_400_2_PUBLIC_ZONES_PLAYERS_CARDS_FACES(Condition),

    // 400.3. If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to its owner’s corresponding zone.
    RULE_400_3_OBJECT_LIBRARY_GRAVEYARD_HAND_THAN(Condition),

    // 400.4. Cards with certain card types can’t enter certain zones.
    // 400.4a. If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.
    // 400.4b. If a conspiracy, phenomenon, plane, scheme, or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    RULE_400_4_CARDS_TYPES_CANT_ENTER_ZONES(Condition),

    // 400.5. The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they’re tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.
    RULE_400_5_ORDER_OBJECTS_LIBRARY_GRAVEYARD_STACK(Condition),

    // 400.6. If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s controller—or its owner if it has no controller—chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does. (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous “destroy” effects.) Then the event moves the object.
    RULE_400_6_OBJECT_MOVE_ZONE_EVENT_MOVING(Condition),

    // 400.7. An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. This rule has the following exceptions.
    // 400.7a. Effects from spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities that change the characteristics or controller of a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes.
    // 400.7b. Effects from static abilities that grant an ability to a permanent spell that functions on the battlefield continue to apply to the permanent that spell becomes (see rule 611.3d).
    // 400.7c. Prevention effects that apply to damage from a permanent spell on the stack continue to apply to damage from the permanent that spell becomes.
    // 400.7d. An ability of a permanent can reference information about the spell that became that permanent as it resolved, including what costs were paid to cast that spell or what mana was spent to pay those costs.
    // 400.7e. Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, “When this Aura is put into a graveyard from the battlefield”) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.
    // 400.7f. Abilities that trigger when an enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new object that each Aura enchanting that permanent became in its owner’s graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that each Aura enchanting it became in its owner’s graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent. (See rule 704.5m.)
    // 400.7g. If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.
    // 400.7h. If an effect allows a nonland card to be cast, other parts of that effect can find the new object that card becomes after it moves to the stack as a result of being cast this way.
    // 400.7i. If an effect allows a land card to be played, other parts of that effect can find the new object that land card becomes after it moves to the battlefield as a result of being played this way.
    // 400.7j. If an effect causes an object to move to a public zone, other parts of that effect can find that object. If the cost of a spell or ability causes an object to move to a public zone, that spell or ability’s effects can find that object.
    // 400.7k. After resolving a madness triggered ability (see rule 702.35), if the exiled card wasn’t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that object.
    // 400.7m. Stickers on an object in a public zone are retained as it moves to another public zone (see rule 123.5). Any effects from stickers continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone.
    RULE_400_7_EFFECTS_SPELLS_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES_TRIGGERED(Condition),

    // 400.8. If an object in the exile zone is exiled, it doesn’t change zones, but it becomes a new object that has just been exiled.

    // 400.11. An object is outside the game if it isn’t in any of the game’s zones. Outside the game is not a zone.
    // 400.11a. Cards in a player’s sideboard are outside the game. See rule 100.4.
    // 400.11b. Some effects bring cards into a game from outside the game. Those cards remain in the game until the game ends, their owner leaves the game, or a rule or effect removes them from the game, whichever comes first.
    // 400.11c. Cards outside the game can’t be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining abilities printed on them (see rule 604.3) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into the game.
    RULE_400_11_OBJECT_OUTSIDE_GAME_ISNT_ZONES(Condition),

    // 400.12. Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as “Shuffle your hand into your library”). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.

    RULE_401_3_PLAYER_COUNT_NUMBER_CARDS_REMAINING(Condition),

    // 401.4. If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go into the library.
    RULE_401_4_EFFECT_PUTS_CARDS_POSITION_LIBRARY(Condition),

    // 401.5. Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a spell is being cast, the new top card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a player is taking a special action (see rule 116, “Special Actions”), the new card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until the player has finished taking that special action.
    RULE_401_5_EFFECTS_TELL_PLAYER_PLAY_TOP(Condition),

    // 401.6. If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.
    RULE_401_6_EFFECT_CAUSES_PLAYER_PLAY_TOP(Condition),

    // 401.7. If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library “Nth from the top,” and that library has fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.
    RULE_401_7_EFFECT_CAUSES_PLAYER_PUT_CARD(Condition),

    // 402.1. The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player’s hand by other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that player’s starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”)
    RULE_402_1_HAND_WHERE_PLAYER_HOLDS_CARDS(Condition),

    // 402.2. Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.
    RULE_402_2_PLAYER_MAXIMUM_HAND_SIZE_CARDS,

    // 402.3. A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player can’t look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time.
    RULE_402_3_PLAYER_ARRANGE_HAND_CONVENIENT_FASHION(Condition),

    // 403.1. Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty. Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some cases (such as an Aura attached to another player’s permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.
    RULE_403_1_AREA_PLAYERS_BATTLEFIELD_STARTS_OUT(Condition),

    // 403.2. A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone.
    RULE_403_2_SPELL_ABILITY_AFFECTS_CHECKS_BATTLEFIELD(Condition),

    // 403.3. Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule 110, “Permanents.”
    RULE_403_3_PERMANENTS_EXIST_BATTLEFIELD_OBJECT,

    // 403.4. Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule 400.7. (This is also true for any objects entering any zone.)
    RULE_403_4_PERMANENT_ENTERS_BATTLEFIELD_BECOMES_NEW(Condition),

    // 403.5. Previously, the battlefield was called the “in-play zone.” Cards that were printed with text that contains the phrases “in play,” “from play,” “into play,” or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
    RULE_403_5_PREVIOUSLY_BATTLEFIELD_PLAY_ZONE_CARDS,

    // 404.1. A player’s graveyard is their discard pile. Any object that’s countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its owner’s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that’s finished resolving. Each player’s graveyard starts out empty.
    RULE_404_1_PLAYERS_GRAVEYARD_DISCARD_PILE_OBJECT,

    // 404.2. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally can’t change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.
    RULE_404_2_GRAVEYARD_KEPT_SINGLE_FACE_PILE(Condition),

    // 404.3. If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
    RULE_404_3_EFFECT_PUTS_CARDS_GRAVEYARD_TIME(Condition),

    // 405.1. When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule 601.2a). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules 602.2a and 603.3).
    RULE_405_1_SPELL_CAST_PHYSICAL_CARD_PUT(Condition),

    // 405.2. The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, it’s put on top of all objects already there.
    RULE_405_2_STACK_KEEPS_TRACK_ORDER_SPELLS,

    // 405.3. If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each other player’s objects in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.
    RULE_405_3_EFFECT_PUTS_OBJECTS_STACK_TIME(Condition),

    // 405.4. Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability that’s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the player who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
    RULE_405_4_SPELL_CHARACTERISTICS_CARD_ASSOCIATED_ACTIVATED(Condition),

    // 405.5. When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.
    RULE_405_5_PLAYERS_PASS_SUCCESSION_TOP_LAST(Condition),

    // 405.6. Some things that happen during the game don’t use the stack.
    // 405.6a. Effects don’t go on the stack; they’re the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule 603.7).
    // 405.6b. Static abilities continuously generate effects and don’t go on the stack. (See rule 604, “Handling Static Abilities.”) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as “[This object] is red” (see rule 604.3).
    // 405.6c. Mana abilities resolve immediately. If a mana ability both produces mana and has another effect, the mana is produced and the other effect happens immediately. If a player had priority before a mana ability was activated, that player gets priority after it resolves. (See rule 605, “Mana Abilities.”)
    // 405.6d. Special actions don’t use the stack; they happen immediately. See rule 116, “Special Actions.”
    // 405.6e. Turn-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority (see rule 117.3a). Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule 703.
    // 405.6f. State-based actions don’t use the stack; they happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule 704. They are dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule 117.5.
    // 405.6g. A player may concede the game at any time. That player leaves the game immediately. See rule 104.3a.
    // 405.6h. If a player leaves a multiplayer game, objects may leave the game, cease to exist, change control, or be exiled as a result. These actions happen immediately. See rule 800.4a.
    RULE_405_6_THINGS_HAPPEN_GAME_DONT_STACK(Condition),

    // 406.1. The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.
    RULE_406_1_EXILE_ZONE_ESSENTIALLY_HOLDING_AREA,

    // 406.2. To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it’s currently in. An exiled card is a card that’s been put into the exile zone.
    RULE_406_2_EXILE_OBJECT_PUT_ZONE_CURRENTLY,

    // 406.3. Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards “exiled face down” can’t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, if a player is instructed to look at a card and then exile it face down, or once a player is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card until it leaves the exile zone or is part of a pile of cards that are shuffled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies.
    // 406.3a. A card exiled face down has no characteristics, but the spell or ability that exiled it may allow it to be played from exile. Unless that card is being cast face down (see rule 708.4), the card is turned face up just before the player announces that they are playing the card (see rule 601.2).
    // 406.3b. Some spells and abilities allow a player to cast spells with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may cast such a spell only if they are allowed to look at the face-down card in exile and if the resulting spell has the specified qualities.
    RULE_406_3_EXILED_CARDS_DEFAULT_KEPT_FACE(Condition),

    // 406.4. Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isn’t revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule 601.2i.)
    RULE_406_4_FACE_CARDS_EXILE_KEPT_SEPARATE(Condition),

    // 406.5. Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.
    RULE_406_5_EXILED_CARDS_RETURN_BATTLEFIELD_ZONE,

    // 406.6. An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”
    RULE_406_6_OBJECT_ABILITY_PRINTED_CAUSES_CARDS,

    RULE_406_7_OBJECT_EXILE_ZONE_BECOMES_EXILED(Condition),

    // 406.8. Previously, the exile zone was called the “removed-from-the-game zone.” Cards that were printed with text that “removes [an object] from the game” exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text that “sets [an object] aside.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
    RULE_406_8_PREVIOUSLY_EXILE_ZONE_REMOVED_GAME,

    // 407.1. Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing “for keeps.” Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and it’s allowed only where it’s not forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/rules-documents).
    RULE_407_1_EARLIER_VERSIONS_MAGIC_INCLUDED_ANTE,

    // 407.2. When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards.

    RULE_500_1_TURN_CONSISTS_PHASES_ORDER_BEGINNING(Condition),

    // 500.2. A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession.

If it’s night and the previous turn’s active player cast two or more spells during that turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule 731, “Day and Night.”
    // 502.2a. Multiplayer games using the shared team turns option use a modified rule. If it’s day and no player on the previous turn’s active team cast a spell during that turn, it becomes night. If it’s night and any player on the previous turn’s active team cast two or more spells during the previous turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.

    // 502.3. Third, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Normally, all of a player’s permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents from untapping.
    RULE_502_3_ACTIVE_PLAYER_PERMANENTS_CONTROL_UNTAP,

In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat phase (see rule 506, “Combat Phase”). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and collectively known as the main phase.
    // 505.1a. Only the first main phase of the turn is a precombat main phase. All other main phases are postcombat main phases. This includes the second main phase of a turn in which the combat phase has been skipped. It is also true of a turn in which an effect has caused an additional combat phase and an additional main phase to be created.

    // 505.6. Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)
    // 505.6a. The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally cast artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and sorcery spells. The active player may cast these spells.
    // 505.6b. During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from their hand if the stack is empty, if the player has priority, and if they haven’t played a land this turn (unless an effect states the player may play additional lands). This action doesn’t use the stack. Neither the land nor the action of playing the land is a spell or ability, so it can’t be countered, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities. (See rule 305, “Lands.”)
    RULE_505_6_ACTIVE_PLAYER_PRIORITY(Condition),

    // 506.1. The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule 508.8). There are two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see rule 702.4).
    RULE_506_1_COMBAT_PHASE_STEPS_PROCEED_ORDER(Condition),

    // 506.2. During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player, planeswalkers they control, and battles they protect may be attacked.
    // 506.2a. During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or more defending players, depending on the variant being played and the options chosen for it. Unless all the attacking player’s opponents automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the attacking player chooses one of their opponents as a turn-based action during the beginning of combat step. (Note that the choice may be dictated by the variant being played or the options chosen for it.) That player becomes the defending player. See rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option,” rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 809, “Emperor Variant.”
    // 506.2b. In multiplayer games using the shared team turns option, the active team is the attacking team and the nonactive team is the defending team. See rule 805, “Shared Team Turns Option.”

    // 506.3. Only a creature can attack or block. Only a player, a planeswalker, or a battle can be attacked.
    // 506.3a. If an effect would put a noncreature permanent onto the battlefield attacking or blocking, the permanent does enter the battlefield but it’s never considered to be an attacking or blocking permanent.
    // 506.3b. If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking under the control of any player except an attacking player, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an attacking creature.
    // 506.3c. If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield attacking either a player not in the game or a permanent that’s no longer on the battlefield or isn’t either a planeswalker or a battle, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be an attacking creature. See rule 508.4a.
    // 506.3d. If an effect puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking during the declare blockers step, combat damage step, or end of combat step, that creature enters the battlefield unblocked. See rule 508.4d.
    // 506.3e. If an effect would put a creature onto the battlefield blocking but the creature it would block isn’t attacking the entering creature’s controller, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects, that creature does enter the battlefield, but it’s never considered to be a blocking creature.
    // 506.3f. If an effect would put a creature that’s also a battle onto the battlefield attacking or blocking, that permanent enters the battlefield but it’s never considered to be an attacking or blocking creature.
    // 506.3g. If a resolving spell or ability would cause a battle to become an attacking or blocking creature, that part of the effect does nothing.
    RULE_506_3_CREATURE_ATTACK_BLOCK_PLAYER_PLANESWALKER(Condition),

    // 506.4. A permanent is removed from combat if it leaves the battlefield, if its controller changes, if it phases out, if an effect specifically removes it from combat, if it’s a planeswalker that’s being attacked and stops being a planeswalker, if it’s a battle that’s being attacked and stops being a battle, or if it’s an attacking or blocking creature that regenerates (see rule 701.19), stops being a creature, or becomes a battle. A creature that’s removed from combat stops being an attacking, blocking, blocked, and/or unblocked creature. A planeswalker or battle that’s removed from combat stops being attacked.
    // 506.4a. Once a creature has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature, spells or abilities that would have kept that creature from attacking or blocking don’t remove the creature from combat.
    // 506.4b. Tapping or untapping a creature that’s already been declared as an attacker or blocker doesn’t remove it from combat and doesn’t prevent its combat damage.
    // 506.4c. If a creature is attacking a planeswalker or battle, removing that planeswalker or battle from combat doesn’t remove that creature from combat. It continues to be an attacking creature, although it is not attacking any player, planeswalker, or battle. It may be blocked. If it is unblocked, it will deal no combat damage.
    // 506.4d. A permanent that’s both a blocking creature and a planeswalker that’s being attacked is removed from combat if it stops being both a creature and a planeswalker. If it stops being one of those card types but continues to be the other, it continues to be either a blocking creature or a planeswalker that’s being attacked, whichever is appropriate.
    // 506.4e. A permanent that’s being attacked that is both a planeswalker and a battle is removed from combat if it stops being both a planeswalker and a battle. If it stops being a battle but is still a planeswalker, it is removed from combat only if it is not controlled by its protector. If it stops being a planeswalker but is still a battle, it is not removed from combat. It continues to be a battle that’s being attacked.

    // 506.5. A creature attacks alone if it’s the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step. A creature is attacking alone if it’s attacking but no other creatures are. A creature blocks alone if it’s the only creature declared as a blocker during the declare blockers step. A creature is blocking alone if it’s blocking but no other creatures are.
    RULE_506_5_CREATURE_ATTACKS_ALONE_DECLARED_ATTACKER(Condition),

    // 506.6. Some abilities check to see whether or not a creature “had to attack” during a particular combat phase. A creature had to attack if one or more effects were requiring that creature to attack at the time attackers were declared in that combat. A creature did not “have to attack” if there were no such effects that required it to attack, even if there were no other legal attacks that could have been declared. (See rule 508.)
    RULE_506_6_ABILITIES_CHECK_CREATURE_ATTACK_COMBAT(Condition),

    // 506.7. Some spells state that they may be cast “only [before/after] [a particular point in the combat phase],” in which that point may be “attackers are declared,” “blockers are declared,” “the combat damage step,” “the end of combat step,” “the combat phase,” or “combat.”
    // 506.7a. A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) attackers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring attackers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare attackers step begins, regardless of whether any attackers are actually declared. (See rule 508.)
    // 506.7b. A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) blockers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring blockers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare blockers step begins, regardless of whether any blockers are actually declared. (See rule 509.)
    // 506.7c. Some spells state that they may be cast only “during combat” or “during a certain player’s combat phase” in addition to the criteria described in rule 506.7. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast at an appropriate time during any of them.
    // 506.7d. Some spells state that they may be cast “only before (or after) [a particular point in the combat phase],” but don’t meet the additional criteria described in rule 506.7c. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast that turn only before (or after) the stated point of the first combat phase.
    // 506.7e. If a spell states that it may be cast “only before [a particular point in the combat phase],” but the stated point doesn’t exist within the relevant combat phase because the declare blockers step and the combat damage step are skipped (see rule 508.8), then the spell may be cast only before the declare attackers step ends. If the stated point doesn’t exist because the relevant combat phase has been skipped, then the spell may be cast only before the precombat main phase ends.
    // 506.7f. If a spell states that it may be cast “only during combat after blockers are declared,” but the declare blockers step is skipped that combat phase (see rule 508.8), then the spell may not be cast during that combat phase.
    // 506.7g. Rules 506.7 and 506.7a–f apply to abilities that state that they may be activated only at certain times with respect to combat just as they apply to spells that state that they may be cast only at certain times with respect to combat.

    // 508.1. First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
    // 508.1a. The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, they can’t also be battles, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began.
    // 508.1b. If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, is the protector of any battles, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player, planeswalker, or battle each of the chosen creatures is attacking.
    // 508.1c. The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t attack, or that it can’t attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.
    // 508.1d. The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature can’t attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.
    // 508.1e. If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a “bands with other” ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule 702.22, “Banding.”)
    // 508.1f. The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it’s declared as an attacker isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.
    // 508.1g. If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may pay “as” a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.
    // 508.1h. If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.
    // 508.1i. If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, “Mana Abilities”).
    // 508.1j. Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.
    // 508.1k. Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.

    // 508.2a. Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition.
    // 508.2b. Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rules 508.1 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
    RULE_508_2_ACTIVE_PLAYER_PRIORITY(Condition),

Such abilities won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.
    // 508.3b. An ability that reads “Whenever [a player, planeswalker, or battle] is attacked, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or permanent. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking that player or permanent.
    // 508.3c. An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .” triggers if a creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.
    // 508.3d. An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures that player controls are declared as attackers.
    // 508.3e. An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks [another player], . . .” triggers if one or more creatures the first player controls are declared as attackers attacking the second player. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking or if a creature attacks a planeswalker or a battle.
    // 508.3f. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers during the declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule 509.3g.

If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects it’s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects it’s attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are “attacking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never “attacked.” They remain attacking creatures until they’re removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first.
    // 508.4a. If a creature would be put onto the battlefield attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if a creature would be put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker or battle and that permanent is no longer on the battlefield, is no longer a planeswalker or battle, is a planeswalker that is no longer controlled by a defending player, or is a battle that is no longer protected by a defending player.
    // 508.4b. If the effect that states a creature is attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature doesn’t become an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is attacking a planeswalker or battle and, when the effect resolves, that permanent is no longer on the battlefield, is no longer a planeswalker or battle, is a planeswalker that is no longer controlled by a defending player, or is a battle that is no longer protected by a defending player.

If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat.
    // 508.5a. In a multiplayer game, any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures.

    // 509.1f. Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.
    // 509.1g. Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule 506.4.
    // 509.1h. An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature. This remains unchanged until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes blocked or unblocked, or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it are removed from combat.
    // 509.1i. Any abilities that trigger on blockers being declared trigger. See rule 509.2a for more information.

    // 509.2. Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)
    // 509.2a. Any abilities that triggered on blockers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rule 509.1 are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
    RULE_509_2_ACTIVE_PLAYER_PRIORITY,

    // 509.3. Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
    // 509.3a. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the result of an effect, but only if it wasn’t a blocking creature at that time. (See rule 509.1g.) It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.
    // 509.3b. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .” triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.
    // 509.3c. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it’s blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a creature that’s put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule 509.1h.)
    // 509.3d. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .” triggers once for each creature that blocks the specified creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It won’t trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.
    // 509.3e. If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared. Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.
    // 509.3f. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition later on.
    // 509.3g. An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It won’t trigger if the attacking creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.
    RULE_509_3_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_BLOCKERS_DECLARED(Condition),

    // 509.4. If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature it’s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s blocking). A creature put onto the battlefield this way is “blocking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never “blocked.”
    // 509.4a. If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield blocking specifies it’s blocking a certain creature and that creature is no longer attacking, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered a blocking creature. The same is true if the controller of the creature that’s put onto the battlefield blocking isn’t a defending player for the specified attacking creature.
    // 509.4b. A creature that’s put onto the battlefield blocking isn’t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of blockers.
    RULE_509_4_CREATURE_PUT_ONTO_BATTLEFIELD_BLOCKING(Condition),

    // 510.1. First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. A player assigns a creature’s combat damage according to the following rules:
    // 510.1a. Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat damage equal to its power. Creatures that would assign 0 or less damage this way don’t assign combat damage at all.
    // 510.1b. An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player, planeswalker, or battle it’s attacking. If it isn’t currently attacking anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left the battlefield), it assigns no combat damage.
    // 510.1c. A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures divided as its controller chooses among them.
    // 510.1d. A blocking creature assigns combat damage to the creatures it’s blocking. If it isn’t currently blocking any creatures (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If it’s blocking exactly one creature, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If it’s blocking two or more creatures, it assigns its combat damage divided as its controller chooses among them.
    // 510.1e. Once a player has assigned combat damage from each attacking or blocking creature they control, the total damage assignment (not solely the damage assignment of any individual attacking or blocking creature) is checked to see if it complies with the above rules. If it doesn’t, the combat damage assignment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that player began to assign combat damage. (See rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions.”)
    RULE_510_1_ACTIVE_PLAYER_ANNOUNCES_HOW_ATTACKING(Condition),

    // 510.2. Second, all combat damage that’s been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is assigned and the time it’s dealt.
    RULE_510_2_COMBAT_DAMAGE_THATS_ASSIGNED_DEALT,

    // 510.3. Third, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)
    // 510.3a. Any abilities that triggered on damage being dealt or while state-based actions are performed afterward are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
    RULE_510_3_ACTIVE_PLAYER_PRIORITY,

    // 510.4. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.
    RULE_510_4_ATTACKING_BLOCKING_CREATURE_STRIKE_DOUBLE(Condition),

    // 511.1. The end of combat step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)
    RULE_511_1_END_COMBAT_STEP_TURN_BASED,

    // 511.2. Abilities that trigger “at end of combat” trigger as the end of combat step begins. Effects that last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase.
    RULE_511_2_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_END_COMBAT_STEP(Condition),

    // 511.3. As soon as the end of combat step ends, all creatures, battles, and planeswalkers are removed from combat. After the end of combat step ends, the combat phase is over and the postcombat main phase begins (see rule 505).
    RULE_511_3_SOON_END_COMBAT_STEP_CREATURES,

    // 512.1. The ending phase consists of two steps: end and cleanup.
    RULE_512_1_ENDING_PHASE_CONSISTS_STEPS_END,

    // 513.1. The end step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.”)
    // 513.1a. Previously, abilities that triggered at the beginning of the end step were printed with the trigger condition “at end of turn.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference to say “at the beginning of the end step” or “at the beginning of the next end step.”
    RULE_513_1_END_STEP_TURN_BASED_ACTIONS(Condition),

    // 513.2. If a permanent with an ability that triggers “at the beginning of the end step” enters the battlefield during this step, that ability won’t trigger until the next turn’s end step. Likewise, if a delayed triggered ability that triggers “at the beginning of the next end step” is created during this step, that ability won’t trigger until the next turn’s end step. In other words, the step doesn’t “back up” so those abilities can go on the stack. This rule applies only to triggered abilities; it doesn’t apply to continuous effects whose durations say “until end of turn” or “this turn.” (See rule 514, “Cleanup Step.”)
    RULE_513_2_PERMANENT_ABILITY_TRIGGERS_BEGINNING_END(Condition),

    // 514.1. First, if the active player’s hand contains more cards than their maximum hand size (normally seven), they discard enough cards to reduce their hand size to that number. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
    RULE_514_1_ACTIVE_PLAYERS_HAND_CONTAINS_CARDS(Condition),

    // 514.2. Second, the following actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents (including phased-out permanents) is removed and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
    RULE_514_2_ACTIONS_HAPPEN_SIMULTANEOUSLY_DAMAGE_MARKED,

    // 514.3. Normally, no player receives priority during the cleanup step, so no spells can be cast and no abilities can be activated. However, this rule is subject to the following exception:
    // 514.3a. At this point, the game checks to see if any state-based actions would be performed and/or any triggered abilities are waiting to be put onto the stack (including those that trigger “at the beginning of the next cleanup step”). If so, those state-based actions are performed, then those triggered abilities are put on the stack, then the active player gets priority. Players may cast spells and activate abilities. Once the stack is empty and all players pass in succession, another cleanup step begins.
    RULE_514_3_POINT_GAME_CHECKS_STATE_BASED(Condition),

    // --- 6. Spells, Abilities, and Effects ---

    // 601.1. Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.
    // 601.1a. Some effects still refer to “playing” a card. “Playing a card” means playing that card as a land or casting that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.
    RULE_601_1_PREVIOUSLY_ACTION_CASTING_SPELL_CARD,

    // 601.2. To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules 601.2a–d) and determination and payment of costs (rules 601.2f–h). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule 601.3). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
    // 601.2a. To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. Any continuous effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as you start casting it begin as it is put on the stack (see rule 611.2f). Any one-shot effects that cause the spell to gain abilities as you cast it apply as it is put on the stack (see rule 610.5). The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, it’s countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere.
    // 601.2b. If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule 700.2). If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule 702.47), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as it’s being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules 118.8 and 118.9), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule 601.2f). A player can’t apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it’s being cast (such as an {X} in its mana cost; see rule 107.3), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or a corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.
    // 601.2c. The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; they’ll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.)
    // 601.2d. If the spell requires the player to divide or distribute an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets, the player announces the division. Each of these targets must receive at least one of whatever is being divided.
    // 601.2e. The game checks to see if the proposed spell can legally be cast. If the proposed spell is illegal, the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
    // 601.2f. The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule 601.2b), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be {0}. It can’t be reduced to less than {0}. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.
    // 601.2g. If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule 605, “Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.
    // 601.2h. The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that don’t involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t be paid.
    // 601.2i. Once the steps described in 601.2a–h are completed, effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as it’s cast are applied, then the spell becomes cast. Any abilities that trigger when a spell is cast or put onto the stack trigger at this time. If the spell’s controller had priority before casting it, they get priority.
    RULE_601_2_CAST_SPELL_WHERE_HAND_PUT(Condition),

    // 601.3. A player can begin to cast a spell only if a rule or effect allows that player to cast it and no rule or effect prohibits that player from casting it.
    // 601.3a. If an effect prohibits a player from casting a spell with certain qualities, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause those qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.
    // 601.3b. If an effect allows a player to cast a spell with certain qualities as though it had flash, that player may consider any choices to be made during that spell’s proposal that may cause that spell’s qualities to change. If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.
    // 601.3c. If an effect allows a player to cast a spell as though it had flash only if an alternative or additional cost is paid, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.
    // 601.3d. If a spell would have flash only if certain conditions are met, its controller may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash if those conditions are met.
    // 601.3e. Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the object’s characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered.
    // 601.3f. Some effects allow a player to cast a spell with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may begin to cast such a spell only if they can look at the face-down card in exile.
    RULE_601_3_PLAYER_BEGIN_CAST_SPELL_EFFECT(Condition),

    // 601.4. While announcing the choices of any modes, alternative costs, and/or additional costs as described in rule 601.2b, some options may be available to a player only if other choices are made that would normally be made later in that rule’s instructions. In that case, the spell’s controller may consider any other choices to be made in that step. If any such choices could allow them to choose a particular mode, alternative cost, or additional cost, they may do so.
    RULE_601_4_ANNOUNCING_CHOICES_MODES_ALTERNATIVE_COSTS(Condition),

    // 601.5. If a player is no longer allowed to cast a spell after completing its proposal (see rules 601.2a–d), the casting of the spell is illegal and the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”). It doesn’t matter if a rule or effect would make the casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spell’s costs (see rules 601.2f–h) or any time after the spell has been cast.
    // 601.5a. Once a player has begun casting a spell that had flash because certain conditions were met or that could be cast as though it had flash because certain conditions were met (see 601.3d), they may continue to cast that spell as though it had flash even if those conditions stop being met.
    RULE_601_5_PLAYER_LONGER_ALLOWED_CAST_SPELL(Condition),

    // 601.6. Some spells specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being cast, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the spell’s controller normally would do so.
    // 601.6a. If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the spell’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.
    // 601.6b. If the spell instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the spell is being cast, the spell’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.

    RULE_601_7_CASTING_SPELL_ALTERS_COSTS_WONT,

    // 602.1. Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]”
    // 602.1a. The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by the player who is activating it.
    // 602.1b. Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they appear last, after the ability’s effect.
    // 602.1c. An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.
    // 602.1d. Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.
    // 602.1e. If a spell or ability that refers to the “activation cost” of an ability modifies how a player may pay that cost, that modification applies to the total cost of that ability, even if that cost is increased and/or decreased by other effects. See rules 602.2b and 601.2f.
    RULE_602_1_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES_COST_EFFECT_WRITTEN(Condition),

    // 602.2. To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made.
    // 602.2a. The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed (see rule 701.20a). That ability is created on the stack as an object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
    // 602.2b. The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2b–i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability’s analog to a spell’s mana cost (as referenced in rule 601.2f) is its activation cost.
    RULE_602_2_ACTIVATE_ABILITY_PUT_ONTO_STACK(Condition),

    // 602.3. Some abilities specify that one of their controller’s opponents does something the controller would normally do while it’s being activated, such as choose a mode or choose targets. In these cases, the opponent does so when the ability’s controller normally would do so.
    // 602.3a. If there is more than one opponent who could make such a choice, the ability’s controller decides which of those opponents will make the choice.
    // 602.3b. If the ability instructs its controller and another player to do something at the same time as the ability is being activated, the ability’s controller goes first, then the other player. This is an exception to rule 101.4.
    RULE_602_3_ABILITIES_SPECIFY_CONTROLLERS_OPPONENTS_SOMETHING(Condition),

    // 602.4. Activating an ability that alters costs won’t affect spells and abilities that are already on the stack.
    RULE_602_4_ACTIVATING_ABILITY_ALTERS_COSTS_WONT,

    // 602.5. A player can’t begin to activate an ability that’s prohibited from being activated.
    // 602.5a. A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol ({T}) or the untap symbol ({Q}) in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control since the start of their most recent turn. Ignore this rule for creatures with haste (see rule 702.10).
    // 602.5b. If an activated ability has a restriction on its use (for example, “Activate only once each turn”), the restriction continues to apply to that object even if its controller changes.
    // 602.5c. If an object acquires an activated ability with a restriction on its use from another object, that restriction applies only to that ability as acquired from that object. It doesn’t apply to other, identically worded abilities.
    // 602.5d. Activated abilities that read “Activate only as a sorcery” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting a sorcery spell, though the ability isn’t actually a sorcery. The player doesn’t actually need to have a sorcery card that they could cast.
    // 602.5e. Activated abilities that read “Activate only as an instant” mean the player must follow the timing rules for casting an instant spell, though the ability isn’t actually an instant. The player doesn’t actually need to have an instant card that they could cast.
    RULE_602_5_PLAYER_CANT_BEGIN_ACTIVATE_ABILITY(Condition),

    // 603.1. Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[When/Whenever/At] [trigger condition or event], [effect]. [Instructions (if any).]”
    // 603.1a. A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target or state that it can’t be countered. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions while the ability is on the stack.
    // 603.1b. A triggered ability may have more than one trigger condition, and an instruction that refers to whether “all” of those conditions have happened during a particular period. This refers to whether or not all of those conditions have occurred during that period, regardless of whether that ability has triggered based on those conditions.
    RULE_603_1_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_CONDITION_EFFECT(Condition),

    // 603.2. Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesn’t do anything at this point.
    // 603.2a. Because they aren’t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don’t affect them.
    // 603.2b. When a phase or step begins, all abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger.
    // 603.2c. An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences.
    // 603.2d. An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers. An effect that states a triggered ability of an object triggers additional times refers only to triggered abilities that object has, not to any delayed or reflexive triggered abilities (see rule 603.7 and rule 603.12) that may be created by abilities the object has.
    // 603.2e. Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens—they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” or “becomes untapped” doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.
    // 603.2f. If a triggered ability’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.
    // 603.2g. An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything.
    // 603.2h. A triggered ability may have an instruction followed by “Do this only once each turn.” This ability triggers only if its source’s controller has not yet taken the indicated action that turn.
    RULE_603_2_GAME_EVENT_STATE_MATCHES_TRIGGERED(Condition),

    // 603.3. Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that’s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule 117, “Timing and Priority.” The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
    // 603.3a. A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules 603.7d–f.
    // 603.3b. If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, the abilities are placed on the stack in a two-part process. First, each player, in APNAP order, puts each triggered ability they control with a trigger condition that isn’t another ability triggering on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule 101.4.) Second, each player, in APNAP order, puts all remaining triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. Then the game once again checks for and performs state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.
    // 603.3c. If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 700.2.)
    // 603.3d. The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules 601.2c–d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.
    RULE_603_3_ONCE_ABILITY_TRIGGERED_CONTROLLER_PUTS(Condition),

    // 603.4. A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)
    RULE_603_4_TRIGGERED_ABILITY_READ_TRIGGER_EVENT(Condition),

    // 603.5. Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.
    RULE_603_5_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_EFFECTS_OPTIONAL_CONTAIN(Condition),

    // 603.6. Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.
    // 603.6a. Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written, “When [this object] enters, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] enters, . . .” Each time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.
    // 603.6b. Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule 603.6d).
    // 603.6c. Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule 603.10.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.
    // 603.6d. Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] enters with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters . . . ,” “[This permanent] enters as . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters tapped.” Such text is a static ability—not a triggered ability—whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.
    // 603.6e. Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield. These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner’s graveyard after state-based actions have been checked. See rule 400.7.
    RULE_603_6_TRIGGER_EVENTS_INVOLVE_OBJECTS_CHANGING(Condition),

    // 603.7. An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the ability.
    // 603.7a. Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.
    // 603.7b. A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the ability doesn’t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event causes the ability to trigger.
    // 603.7c. A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it’s a new object and thus won’t be affected. See rule 400.7.)
    // 603.7d. If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved.
    // 603.7e. If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.
    // 603.7f. If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied.
    // 603.7g. If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken.
    // 603.7h. An activated or triggered ability may create a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the ability that created it has resolved a certain number of times in a turn. In that case, that delayed triggered ability is created only once, during the appropriate resolution of that ability.
    RULE_603_7_EFFECT_CREATE_DELAYED_TRIGGERED_ABILITY(Condition),

    // 603.8. Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.
    RULE_603_8_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_GAME_STATE(Condition),

    // 603.9. Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule 104.3.
    RULE_603_9_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_SPECIFICALLY_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 603.10. Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:
    // 603.10a. Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a player sacrifices a permanent, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library.
    // 603.10b. Abilities that trigger when a permanent phases out look back in time.
    // 603.10c. Abilities that trigger specifically when an object becomes unattached look back in time.
    // 603.10d. Abilities that trigger when a player loses control of an object or when a player’s opponent gains control of an object from that player look back in time.
    // 603.10e. Abilities that trigger when a spell is countered look back in time.
    // 603.10f. Abilities that trigger when a player loses the game look back in time.
    // 603.10g. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks away from a plane look back in time.
    RULE_603_10_OBJECTS_EXIST_IMMEDIATELY_EVENT_CHECKED(Condition),

    // 603.11. Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability that’s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.
    RULE_603_11_OBJECTS_STATIC_ABILITY_THATS_LINKED(Condition),

    // 603.12. A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] [does or doesn’t]” take that action or “when [something happens] this way.” These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule 603.7), except that they’re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.
    // 603.12a. Normally, if the trigger event or events occur multiple times during the resolution of the spell or ability that created it, the reflexive triggered ability will trigger once for each of those times. However, if a resolving spell or ability includes a choice to pay a cost “any number of times” and creates a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] pays [that cost] one or more times,” paying that cost one or more times causes the reflexive triggered ability to trigger only once.
    RULE_603_12_RESOLVING_SPELL_ABILITY_ALLOW_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 604.1. Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and they’re simply true.
    RULE_604_1_STATIC_ABILITIES_SOMETHING_TIME_RATHER,

    // 604.2. Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule 113.6.
    RULE_604_2_STATIC_ABILITIES_CREATE_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS,

    // 604.3. Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an object’s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins.
    // 604.3a. A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It defines an object’s colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.
    RULE_604_3_STATIC_ABILITIES_CHARACTERISTIC_DEFINING_CONVEYS(Condition),

    // 604.4. Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.
    RULE_604_4_MANY_AURAS_EQUIPMENT_FORTIFICATIONS_STATIC(Condition),

    // 604.5. Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to cast . . . ,” “You may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost” work while a spell is on the stack.
    RULE_604_5_STATIC_ABILITIES_APPLY_SPELL_STACK,

    // 604.6. Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” “You can’t [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” and “[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .”
    RULE_604_6_STATIC_ABILITIES_APPLY_CARD_ZONE,

    // 604.7. Unlike spells and other kinds of abilities, static abilities can’t use an object’s last known information for purposes of determining how their effects are applied.
    RULE_604_7_UNLIKE_SPELLS_KINDS_ABILITIES_STATIC,

    // 605.1. Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as “Activate only as an instant”) they may have.
    // 605.1a. An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule 115.6), it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves, and it’s not a loyalty ability. (See rule 606, “Loyalty Abilities.”)
    // 605.1b. A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule 115.6), it triggers from the activation or resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule 605.1a) or from mana being added to a player’s mana pool, and it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves.
    RULE_605_1_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES_TRIGGERED_MANA_SUBJECT(Condition),

    // 605.2. A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.
    RULE_605_2_MANA_ABILITY_REMAINS_GAME_STATE(Condition),

    // 605.3. Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see rule 602.2), with the following exceptions:
    // 605.3a. A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment, even if it’s in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.
    // 605.3b. An activated mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule 405.6c.)
    // 605.3c. Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability can’t be activated again until it has resolved.
    RULE_605_3_ACTIVATING_ACTIVATED_MANA_ABILITY_EXCEPTIONS(Condition),

    // 605.4. Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule 603, “Handling Triggered Abilities”), with the following exception:
    // 605.4a. A triggered mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for priority.
    RULE_605_4_TRIGGERED_MANA_ABILITIES_EXCEPTION,

    // 605.5. Abilities that don’t meet the criteria specified in rules 605.1a–b and spells aren’t mana abilities.
    // 605.5a. An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but couldn’t produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.
    // 605.5b. A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. It’s cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type “mana source”; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.
    RULE_605_5_ABILITIES_DONT_MEET_CRITERIA_SPECIFIED(Condition),

    // 606.1. Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities, which are subject to special rules.
    RULE_606_1_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES_LOYALTY_SUBJECT_SPECIAL,

    RULE_606_2_ACTIVATED_ABILITY_LOYALTY_SYMBOL_COST,

    // 606.3. A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn.
    RULE_606_3_PLAYER_ACTIVATE_LOYALTY_ABILITY_PERMANENT(Condition),

    // 606.4. The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability’s cost. This cost may be modified by other effects.
    RULE_606_4_COST_ACTIVATE_LOYALTY_ABILITY_PERMANENT,

    // 606.6. A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost, taking into account any additional costs, can’t be activated unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
    RULE_606_6_LOYALTY_ABILITY_NEGATIVE_COST_ACCOUNT(Condition),

    // 607.1. An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.
    // 607.1a. An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes.
    // 607.1b. An ability printed on either face of a nonmodal double-faced object (see rule 712) is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.
    // 607.1c. An ability printed on an object that fulfills both criteria described in rule 607.1 is linked to itself.
    // 607.1d. Abilities printed on two objects can be linked if one object is a token, emblem, or nontoken permanent and the second object was the source of the ability that either created the token or emblem or put that nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. In these cases, the abilities fit the criteria listed for one of the different kinds of linked abilities in rule 607.2 except they are printed on two objects rather than one.
    RULE_607_1_OBJECT_ABILITIES_PRINTED_CAUSES_ACTIONS(Condition),

    // 607.2. There are different kinds of linked abilities.
    // 607.2a. If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.
    // 607.2b. If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule 614, “Replacement Effects.”
    // 607.2c. If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects “put onto the battlefield with [this object]” or “created with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put onto the battlefield as a result of the first.
    // 607.2d. If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to “choose a [value]” and an ability printed on it that refers to “the chosen [value],” “the last chosen [value],” or similar, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.
    // 607.2e. If an object has an ability printed on it that allows some information to be noted and another ability which refers to information noted for that object, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to information noted as a result of the first ability.
    // 607.2f. If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to choose from between two or more words that otherwise have no rules meaning and an ability printed on it that refers to a choice involving one or more of those words, those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.
    // 607.2g. If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a cost as it enters the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] entered,” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the first ability.
    // 607.2h. If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule 603.11.
    // 607.2i. If an object has an ability printed on it that allows an additional cost to be paid and an ability printed on it that refers to whether that cost was paid, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the additional cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If an ability lists multiple such costs, it may have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which cost it refers to.
    // 607.2j. If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as it’s cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] was cast,” these abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the object was cast as a spell. See rule 601.2b.
    // 607.2k. The two abilities represented by the champion keyword are linked abilities. See rule 702.72, “Champion.”
    // 607.2m. Abilities preceded by an anchor word are linked to the ability that allows a player to choose that anchor word. See rule 614.12b.
    // 607.2n. If an object has a static ability printed on it that allows a player to exile one or more cards “before you shuffle your deck to start the game” and an ability printed on it that refers to cards “exiled with cards named [this object’s name],” the second ability is linked to the first ability of any objects that had the specified name before the game began.
    // 607.2p. If an object has both a static ability that causes a player to make a choice for a characteristic-defining ability before the game begins and that characteristic-defining ability printed on it in the same paragraph, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to the choice made as a result of the first ability and continues to refer to that choice as the object changes zones during the game.
    // 607.2q. If a permanent spell has an ability printed on it that allows one or more cards to be exiled while paying a cost to cast it and the permanent that spell becomes has an ability that refers to cards “exiled with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards exiled to pay the cost of the spell that became that permanent.
    RULE_607_2_KINDS_LINKED_ABILITIES(Condition),

    // 607.3. If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as “the exiled card,” “a card exiled with [this object],” or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability creates a token that is a copy of “the” card, then for each exiled card, it creates a token that is a copy of that card. If that ability performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.
    RULE_607_3_PAIR_LINKED_ABILITIES_SINGLE_OBJECT(Condition),

    // 607.4. An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.
    RULE_607_4_ABILITY_THAN_PAIR_LINKED,

    // 607.5. If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that object even though they weren’t printed on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.
    // 607.5a. If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn’t copy that ability’s linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered to be “undefined.” If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won’t do anything.
    RULE_607_5_OBJECT_ACQUIRES_PAIR_LINKED_ABILITIES(Condition),

    // 608.1. Each time all players pass in succession, the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves. (See rule 609, “Effects.”)
    RULE_608_1_TIME_PLAYERS_PASS_SUCCESSION_SPELL,

    // 608.2. If the object that’s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules 608.2a and 608.2b are followed first. The steps described in rules 608.2c–m are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The steps described in rule 608.2n and 608.2p are followed last.
    // 608.2a. If a triggered ability has an intervening “if” clause, it checks whether the clause’s condition is true. If it isn’t, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule 603.4.
    // 608.2b. If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target that’s no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now illegal, the spell or ability doesn’t resolve. It’s removed from the stack and, if it’s a spell, put into its owner’s graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, won’t be affected by parts of a resolving spell’s effect for which they’re illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule 613.11), those effects don’t apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information won’t happen.
    // 608.2c. The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.
    // 608.2d. If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule 121.3). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule 601.2d.)
    // 608.2e. Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule 101.4.
    // 608.2f. Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions.
    // 608.2g. If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules 601.2a–i, except no player receives priority after it’s cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.
    // 608.2h. If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See rule 113.7a. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.
    // 608.2i. Some effects look back in time and require information about previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state. If such an effect requires information from the game about an object or group of objects, and that effect is not taking any actions on those objects, they don’t need to be currently in the zone they were in at the time of that previous game state or action, nor do they need to currently meet the criteria described in the action, as long as they did so at the specified time. This is an exception to 608.2h.
    // 608.2j. If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.
    // 608.2k. If an ability’s effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by that ability’s cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed characteristics.
    // 608.2m. If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.
    // 608.2n. As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the spell is put into its owner’s graveyard. As the final part of an ability’s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.
    // 608.2p. Once all possible steps described in 608.2c–n are completed, any abilities that trigger when that spell or ability resolves trigger.
    RULE_608_2_OBJECT_THATS_RESOLVING_INSTANT_SPELL(Condition),

    // 608.3. If the object that’s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution may involve several steps. The instructions in rules 608.3a and b are always performed first. Then one of the steps in rule 608.3c–e is performed, if appropriate.
    // 608.3a. If the object that’s resolving has no targets, it becomes a permanent and enters the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller.
    // 608.3b. If the object that’s resolving has a target, it checks whether the target is still legal, as described in 608.2b. If a spell with an illegal target is a bestowed Aura spell (see rule 702.103e) or a mutating creature spell (see rule 702.140b), it becomes a creature spell and will resolve as described in rule 608.3a. Otherwise, the spell doesn’t resolve. It is removed from the stack and put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 608.3c. If the object that’s resolving is an Aura spell, it becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller attached to the player or object it was targeting.
    // 608.3d. If the object that’s resolving is a mutating creature spell, the object representing that spell merges with the permanent it is targeting (see rule 730, “Merging with Permanents”).
    // 608.3e. If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can’t put it onto the battlefield, that player puts it into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 608.3f. If the object that’s resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, it will become a token permanent as it is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. A token put onto the battlefield this way is no longer a copy of a spell and is not “created” for the purposes of any rules or effects that refer to creating a token.
    // 608.3g. If the object that’s resolving has a static ability that functions on the stack and creates a delayed triggered ability, that delayed triggered ability is created as that permanent is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. (See rules 702.109, “Dash,” 702.152, “Blitz,” and 702.185, “Warp.”)
    RULE_608_3_OBJECT_THATS_RESOLVING_PERMANENT_SPELL(Condition),

    // 609.1. An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.
    RULE_609_1_EFFECT_SOMETHING_HAPPENS_GAME_RESULT(Condition),

    // 609.2. Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.

    // 609.3. If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.
    RULE_609_3_EFFECT_ATTEMPTS_SOMETHING_IMPOSSIBLE_MUCH(Condition),

    // 609.4. Some effects state that a player may do something “as though” some condition were true or a creature can do something “as though” some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.
    // 609.4a. If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing “as though” different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one “as though” effect satisfies the requirements for another “as though” effect, then both effects will apply.
    // 609.4b. If an effect allows a player to spend mana “as though it were mana of any [type or color],” this affects only how the player may pay a cost. It doesn’t change that cost, and it doesn’t change what mana was actually spent to pay that cost. The same is true for effects that say “mana of any type can be spent.”
    RULE_609_4_EFFECTS_STATE_PLAYER_SOMETHING_CONDITION(Condition),

    // 609.5. If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.
    RULE_609_5_EFFECT_RESULT_TIE_TEXT_SPELL(Condition),

    // 609.6. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules 614 and 615.
    RULE_609_6_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS_REPLACEMENT_PREVENTION,

    // 609.7. Some effects apply to damage from a source—for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.”
    // 609.7a. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement or prevention effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it’s combat damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability. If the player chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by that spell and any damage dealt by the permanent that spell becomes when it resolves.
    // 609.7b. Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the “shield” rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn’t used up.
    // 609.7c. Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t on the battlefield that have that property.
    RULE_609_7_EFFECT_REQUIRES_PLAYER_CHOOSE_SOURCE(Condition),

    // 610.1. A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.
    RULE_610_1_SHOT_EFFECT_SOMETHING_ONCE_DOESNT,

    // 610.2. Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability that’s creating the one-shot effect resolves. See rule 603.7.
    RULE_610_2_SHOT_EFFECTS_CREATE_DELAYED_TRIGGERED(Condition),

    // 610.3. Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone.
    // 610.3a. If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the object doesn’t move.
    // 610.3b. If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the object doesn’t move.
    // 610.3c. An object returned to the battlefield this way returns under its owner’s control unless otherwise specified.
    // 610.3d. If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.
    RULE_610_3_SHOT_EFFECTS_CAUSE_OBJECT_CHANGE(Condition),

    // 610.4. Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the permanent to phase in.
    // 610.4a. A permanent phased out this way doesn’t phase in as a result of the turn-based action during a player’s untap step (see rule 502.1). Other effects may cause it to phase in. If a permanent phased out this way phases in due to another effect, the second one-shot effect doesn’t happen, even if that permanent has phased out again.
    // 610.4b. If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the permanent doesn’t phase out.
    // 610.4c. If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the permanent doesn’t phase out.
    // 610.4d. If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.
    RULE_610_4_SHOT_EFFECTS_CAUSE_PERMANENT_PHASE(Condition),

    // 610.5. Some static abilities create one-shot effects that cause spells a player casts to gain an ability as that player casts them. These effects begin to apply to appropriate spells at the time the player puts such a spell on the stack. See rule 601.2a.
    RULE_610_5_STATIC_ABILITIES_CREATE_SHOT_EFFECTS(Condition),

    // 611.1. A continuous effect modifies characteristics of objects, modifies control of objects, or affects players or the rules of the game, for a fixed or indefinite period.
    RULE_611_1_CONTINUOUS_EFFECT_MODIFIES_CHARACTERISTICS_OBJECTS,

    // 611.2. A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.
    // 611.2a. A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as “until end of turn”). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game.
    // 611.2b. Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded “for as long as . . . .” If the “for as long as” duration never starts, the effect does nothing. Similarly, if that duration ends before the moment the effect would first be applied and doesn’t begin again during that spell or ability’s resolution, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.
    // 611.2c. If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won’t change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that doesn’t modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren’t affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that don’t, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently.
    // 611.2d. If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule 608.2h.
    // 611.2e. If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a continuous effect stating that the permanent “is [characteristic],” that it “has [characteristic],” or that it doesn’t have a particular characteristic, that continuous effect applies simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent “becomes [characteristic]” or “gains [an ability],” that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield.
    // 611.2f. Some spells and abilities generate a continuous effect that modifies the characteristics of the next spell a player casts, the next spell that fulfills certain conditions a player casts during some duration, or similar. These effects do not begin immediately. Rather, they begin to apply at the time that player next puts an appropriate spell on the stack, and they apply to that spell. See rule 601.2a.
    RULE_611_2_CONTINUOUS_EFFECT_GENERATED_RESOLUTION_SPELL(Condition),

    // 611.3. A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.
    // 611.3a. A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn’t “locked in”; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.
    // 611.3b. The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is on the battlefield or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.
    // 611.3c. Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. They don’t wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.
    // 611.3d. Continuous effects from static abilities may allow a player to play a land or cast a permanent spell, or may grant an ability to a permanent spell or card that allows it to be cast. If the effect also grants that object an ability that functions only on the battlefield, that ability lasts as long as stated by the effect granting that permission or ability. If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game. This is an exception to rules 611.3a–b.
    RULE_611_3_CONTINUOUS_EFFECT_GENERATED_STATIC_ABILITY(Condition),

    // 612.1. Some continuous effects change an object’s text. This can apply to any words or symbols printed on that object, but generally affects only that object’s rules text (which appears in its text box) and/or the text that appears in its type line. Such an effect is a text-changing effect.
    RULE_612_1_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS_CHANGE_OBJECTS_TEXT,

    // 612.2. A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype can’t change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature type.
    // 612.2a. Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens. A text-changing effect that affects such a spell or an object with such an ability can change these words because they’re being used as creature types, even though they’re also being used as names.
    RULE_612_2_TEXT_CHANGING_EFFECT_CHANGES_WORDS(Condition),

    // 613.6. If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.
    RULE_613_6_EFFECT_APPLIED_LAYERS_SUBLAYERS_APPLY(Condition),

    // 613.7. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.
    // 613.7a. A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later. If the effect that created the ability has the later timestamp and the object the ability is on receives a new timestamp, each continuous effect generated by static abilities of that object receives a new timestamp as well, but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.
    // 613.7b. A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time it’s created.
    // 613.7c. Each counter receives a timestamp as it’s put on an object or player. If that object or player already has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the new counter.
    // 613.7d. An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.
    // 613.7e. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an object or player.
    // 613.7f. A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.
    // 613.7g. A double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms or converts.
    // 613.7h. A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time it’s turned face up.
    // 613.7i. A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.
    // 613.7j. A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If it’s face down, it receives a new timestamp at the time it turns face up.
    // 613.7k. A sticker receives a new timestamp each time it’s put on an object. If the object a sticker is on receives a new timestamp, the sticker receives a new timestamp immediately after that one. If the object a sticker is on becomes part of a merged permanent on the battlefield, the sticker receives a new timestamp at that time. If an object has more than one sticker on it as it enters a zone or becomes part of a merged permanent, the relative timestamp order of those stickers remains unchanged.
    // 613.7m. If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order (see rule 101.4). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that player’s choice, followed by each other player in turn order.
    // 613.7n. If a continuous effect generated by a static ability of an object and a continuous effect generated by a resolving spell or ability that applies to that object would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as due to an effect that puts that object onto the battlefield and sets its characteristics (see rule 611.2e), the continuous effect from the object’s own static ability receives an earlier relative timestamp.
    RULE_613_7_LAYER_SUBLAYER_ORDER_EFFECTS_APPLIED(Condition),

    // 613.8. Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.
    // 613.8a. An effect is said to “depend on” another if (a) it’s applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.
    // 613.8b. An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they’re applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.
    // 613.8c. After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that have not yet been applied.

    RULE_613_10_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS_AFFECT_PLAYERS_RATHER,

    // 613.11. Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a player’s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule 601.2f. All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules 613.7 and 613.8).
    RULE_613_11_CONTINUOUS_EFFECTS_AFFECT_GAME_RATHER(Condition),

Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.
    // 614.1a. Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.

    // 614.4. Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened.

    // 614.7. If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn’t do anything.
    // 614.7a. If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
    RULE_614_7_REPLACEMENT_EFFECT_REPLACE_EVENT_HAPPENS(Condition),

    // 614.8. Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word “instead” doesn’t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and its controller taps it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.” Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule 701.19.
    RULE_614_8_REGENERATION_DESTRUCTION_REPLACEMENT_EFFECT_WORD(Condition),

    // 614.9. Some effects replace damage dealt to one battle, creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another battle, creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If one of those permanents is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a battle, creature, or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.
    RULE_614_9_EFFECTS_REPLACE_DAMAGE_DEALT_BATTLE(Condition),

    // 614.10. An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip [something]” is the same as “Instead of doing [something], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped—any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.
    // 614.10a. Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.
    // 614.10b. Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.

Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule 616.1), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.
    // 614.12a. If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.
    // 614.12b. If multiple replacement effects that require choices from a player would modify how multiple permanents enter the battlefield simultaneously, that player may not make choices for those effects that would cause the combined costs of those effects to not be payable.
    // 614.12c. Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controller’s choice of one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. “[Anchor word] — [ability]” means “As long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability].” The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a player to choose between them. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”

An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”

Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word.

    // --- 7. Additional Rules ---

    // 700.1. Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event they’re looking for. One “happening” may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.
    RULE_700_1_ANYTHING_HAPPENS_GAME_EVENT_MULTIPLE,

    // 700.2. A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as “Choose one —.” Each of those options is a mode. Modal cards printed prior to the Khans of Tarkir™ set didn’t use bulleted lists for the modes; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference so the modes do appear in a bulleted list.
    // 700.2a. The controller of a modal spell or activated ability chooses the mode(s) as part of casting that spell or activating that ability. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. (See rule 601.2b.)
    // 700.2b. The controller of a modal triggered ability chooses the mode(s) as part of putting that ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule 603.3c.)
    // 700.2c. If a spell or ability targets one or more targets only if a particular mode is chosen for it, its controller will need to choose those targets only if they chose that mode. Otherwise, the spell or ability is treated as though it did not have those targets. (See rule 601.2c.)
    // 700.2d. If a player is allowed to choose more than one mode for a modal spell or ability, that player normally can’t choose the same mode more than once. However, some modal spells include the instruction “You may choose the same mode more than once.” If a particular mode is chosen multiple times, the spell is treated as if that mode appeared that many times in sequence. If that mode requires a target, the same player or object may be chosen as the target for each of those modes, or different targets may be chosen.
    // 700.2e. Some spells and abilities specify that a player other than their controller chooses a mode for it. In that case, the other player does so when the spell or ability’s controller normally would do so. If there is more than one other player who could make such a choice, the spell or ability’s controller decides which of those players will make the choice.
    // 700.2f. Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a spell or ability’s target can’t change its mode.
    // 700.2g. A copy of a modal spell or ability copies the mode(s) chosen for it. The controller of the copy can’t choose a different mode. (See rule 707.10.)
    // 700.2h. Some modal spells have one or more modes with a cost listed before the effect of that mode. This indicates that the mode has an additional cost that must be paid as the spell is cast if that mode is chosen. If more than one such mode is chosen, all additional costs must be paid to cast that spell. Paying these costs follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 700.2i. Some modal spells have one or more pawprint symbols ({P}) rather than bullet points, as well as an instruction to choose up to a specified number of {P} “worth of modes.” While casting such a spell, its controller can choose any number of modes such that the total number of pawprint symbols listed for the chosen modes is not greater than the specified number.
    RULE_700_2_CONTROLLER_MODAL_SPELL_ACTIVATED_ABILITY(Condition),

    // 700.3. Some effects cause objects to be temporarily grouped into piles.
    // 700.3a. Each of the affected objects must be put into exactly one of those piles, unless the effect specifies otherwise.
    // 700.3b. Each object in a pile is still an individual object. The pile is not an object.
    // 700.3c. Objects grouped into piles don’t leave the zone they’re currently in. If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained.
    // 700.3d. A pile can contain zero or more objects.
    RULE_700_3_EFFECTS_CAUSE_OBJECTS_TEMPORARILY_GROUPED(Condition),

    // 700.4. The term dies means “is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.”
    RULE_700_4_TERM_DIES_PUT_GRAVEYARD_BATTLEFIELD,

    // 700.5. A player’s devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls. A player’s devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2], or both colors.
    // 700.5a. A player’s devotion to each color and combination of colors, taking into account any effects that modify devotion, is calculated after considering any copy, control, or text-changing effects but before any other effects that modify the characteristics of permanents. This is an exception to 613.10. See also rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
    RULE_700_5_PLAYERS_DEVOTION_COLOR_EQUAL_NUMBER,

    // 700.6. The term historic refers to an object that has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga subtype.
    RULE_700_6_TERM_HISTORIC_OBJECT_LEGENDARY_SUPERTYPE,

    // 700.7. If an ability uses a phrase such as “this [something]” to identify an object, where [something] is a characteristic or other quality, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isn’t the appropriate quality at the time.
    RULE_700_7_ABILITY_PHRASE_SOMETHING_IDENTIFY_OBJECT(Condition),

    // 700.8. Some cards refer to a player’s party. A player’s party consists of up to one Cleric creature that player controls, up to one Rogue creature they control, up to one Warrior creature they control, and up to one Wizard creature they control.
    // 700.8a. If a spell, ability, or effect needs to determine the number of creatures in a player’s party, the calculation of that number is performed automatically by the game and results in a number between zero and four. Players don’t declare which specific creatures they control are in their party for such an effect.
    // 700.8b. If a creature has multiple creature types for which it could be the party member, it is counted as the party member for only one of those types. If there are different ways to count such a creature that results in different numbers of creatures in a player’s party, it is counted in such a way to get the highest result.
    // 700.8c. A player has a full party if there are four creatures in that player’s party.
    // 700.8d. One card, Stick Together, instructs players to choose a party from among creatures they control. To do so, for each of the creature types listed in rule 700.8, each player chooses up to one creature they control of that type.
    RULE_700_8_CARDS_PLAYERS_PARTY_CONSISTS_CLERIC(Condition),

    // 700.9. Some cards refer to modified permanents. A permanent is modified if it has one or more counters on it (see rule 122), if it is equipped (see rule 301.5), or if it is enchanted by an Aura that is controlled by that permanent’s controller (see rule 303.4).
    RULE_700_9_CARDS_MODIFIED_PERMANENTS_COUNTERS_EQUIPPED(Condition),

    // 700.10. Some cards refer to a permanent “that was activated this turn.” This means that the permanent was the source of an ability that was activated this turn, regardless of whether that permanent still has that activated ability or the player who activated it is still in the game.
    RULE_700_10_CARDS_PERMANENT_ACTIVATED_TURN_SOURCE,

    // 700.11. Some cards refer to whether a player has “descended this turn.” This means that a permanent card has been put into that player’s graveyard from anywhere this turn. “The number of times [a player] descended this turn” means “the number of permanent cards put into [that player’s] graveyard from anywhere this turn.” In both cases, no permanent cards put into the player’s graveyard that turn are required to still be in that graveyard.
    RULE_700_11_CARDS_PLAYER_DESCENDED_TURN_PERMANENT,

    // 700.12. The term outlaw refers to an object that has the Assassin, Mercenary, Pirate, Rogue, and/or Warlock creature types.
    // 700.12a. Some cards refer to outlaws that a player controls. Only outlaw permanents are considered for these effects unless otherwise specified.
    RULE_700_12_TERM_OUTLAW_OBJECT_ASSASSIN_MERCENARY(Condition),

    // 700.13. Some cards refer to committing a crime. A player commits a crime as that player casts a spell, activates an ability, or puts a triggered ability on the stack and that spell or ability targets at least one opponent; at least one permanent, spell, or ability an opponent controls; and/or at least one card in an opponent’s graveyard.
    RULE_700_13_CARDS_COMMITTING_CRIME_PLAYER_COMMITS(Condition),

    // 700.14. Some abilities trigger “Whenever you expend N.” A player expends N if they pay a cost to cast a spell and the amount of mana that player spent this turn to cast spells prior to paying that cost was less than N and became at least N after paying that cost.
    RULE_700_14_ABILITIES_TRIGGER_EXPEND_N_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 700.15. The term enter[s] is short for “enter[s] the battlefield.”
    RULE_700_15_TERM_ENTER_SHORT_BATTLEFIELD,

    // 701.1. Most actions described in a card’s rules text use the standard English definitions of the verbs within, but some specialized verbs are used whose meanings may not be clear. These “keywords” are game terms; sometimes reminder text summarizes their meanings.
    RULE_701_1_ACTIONS_CARDS_TEXT_STANDARD_ENGLISH,

    // 701.2. Activate
    // 701.2a. To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may activate an ability if they have priority. See rule 602, “Activating Activated Abilities.”
    RULE_701_2_ACTIVATE(Condition),

    // 701.3. Attach
    // 701.3a. To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object or player. If something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it’s customary to place it so that it’s physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification can’t be attached to an object or player it couldn’t enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.
    // 701.3b. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player it can’t be attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesn’t move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to the object or player it’s already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an effect tries to attach an object that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player, the effect does nothing and the first object doesn’t move.
    // 701.3c. Attaching an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification on the battlefield to a different object or player causes the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to receive a new timestamp.
    // 701.3d. To “unattach” an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it, that counts as “becoming unattached [from that object or player]”; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.
    RULE_701_3_ATTACH(Condition),

    // 701.4. Behold
    // 701.4a. “Behold a [quality]” means “Reveal a [quality] card from your hand or choose a [quality] permanent you control on the battlefield.”
    // 701.4b. The phrase “if a [quality] was beheld” refers to whether or not the object had that quality at the time the player took that action, regardless of whether or not the revealed card or chosen permanent still has that quality as the spell or ability including that phrase resolves.
    RULE_701_4_BEHOLD(Condition),

    // 701.5. Cast
    // 701.5a. To cast a spell is to take it from the zone it’s in (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. A player may cast a spell if they have priority. See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”
    // 701.5b. To cast a card is to cast it as a spell.
    RULE_701_5_CAST(Condition),

    // 701.6. Counter
    // 701.6a. To counter a spell or ability means to cancel it, removing it from the stack. It doesn’t resolve and none of its effects occur. A countered spell is put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 701.6b. The player who cast a countered spell or activated a countered ability doesn’t get a “refund” of any costs that were paid.
    RULE_701_6_COUNTER_SPELL_ABILITY_CANCEL_REMOVING,

    // 701.7. Create
    // 701.7a. To create one or more tokens with certain characteristics, put the specified number of tokens with the specified characteristics onto the battlefield.
    // 701.7b. If a replacement effect applies to a token being created, that effect applies before considering any continuous effects that will modify the characteristics of that token. If a replacement effect applies to a token entering the battlefield, that effect applies after considering any continuous effects that will modify the characteristics of that token.
    // 701.7c. Previously, an effect that created tokens instructed a player to “put [those tokens] onto the battlefield.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now “create” those tokens.
    RULE_701_7_CREATE(Condition),

    // 701.8. Destroy
    // 701.8a. To destroy a permanent, move it from the battlefield to its owner’s graveyard.
    // 701.8b. The only ways a permanent can be destroyed are as a result of an effect that uses the word “destroy” or as a result of the state-based actions that check for lethal damage (see rule 704.5g) or damage from a source with deathtouch (see rule 704.5h). If a permanent is put into its owner’s graveyard for any other reason, it hasn’t been “destroyed.”
    // 701.8c. A regeneration effect replaces a destruction event. See rule 701.19, “Regenerate.”
    RULE_701_8_DESTROY(Condition),

    // 701.9. Discard
    // 701.9a. To discard a card, move it from its owner’s hand to that player’s graveyard.
    // 701.9b. By default, effects that cause a player to discard a card allow the affected player to choose which card to discard. Some effects, however, require a random discard or allow another player to choose which card is discarded.
    // 701.9c. If a card is discarded, but an effect causes it to be put into a hidden zone instead of into its owner’s graveyard without being revealed, all values of that card’s characteristics are considered to be undefined. If a card is discarded this way to pay a cost that specifies a characteristic about the discarded card, that cost payment is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the cost was paid (see rule 733, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
    RULE_701_9_DISCARD(Condition),

    // 701.10. Double
    // 701.10a. Doubling a creature’s power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that creature’s power and/or toughness but doesn’t set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule 613.4c.
    // 701.10b. To double a creature’s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is that creature’s power as the spell or ability that doubles its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that doubles a creature’s toughness gives it +0/+X, where X is that creature’s toughness. Doubling a creature’s power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X is its power and Y is its toughness.
    // 701.10c. If a creature’s power is less than 0 when it’s doubled, doubling that creature’s power instead means that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness is less than 0 when doubled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristic’s value is negative but the other isn’t when both are doubled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.
    // 701.10d. To double a player’s life total, the player gains or loses an amount of life such that their new life total is twice its current value.
    // 701.10e. To double the number of a kind of counters on a player or permanent, give that player or permanent as many of those counters as that player or permanent already has.
    // 701.10f. To double the amount of a type of mana in a player’s mana pool, that player adds an amount of mana of that type equal to the amount they already have.
    // 701.10g. To double an amount of damage a source would deal, that source instead deals twice that much damage. This is a replacement effect.
    RULE_701_10_DOUBLE(Condition),

    // 701.11. Triple
    // 701.11a. Tripling a creature’s power and/or toughness creates a continuous effect. This effect modifies that creature’s power and/or toughness but doesn’t set those characteristics to a specific value. See rule 613.4c.
    // 701.11b. To triple a creature’s power, that creature gets +X/+0, where X is twice that creature’s power as the spell or ability that triples its power resolves. Similarly, an effect that triples a creature’s toughness gives it +0/+X, where X is twice that creature’s toughness. Tripling a creature’s power and toughness gives it +X/+Y, where X is twice its power and Y is twice its toughness.
    // 701.11c. If a creature’s power is less than 0 when it’s tripled, tripling that creature’s power instead means that the creature gets -X/-0, where X is twice the difference between 0 and its power. Similarly, if its toughness is less than 0 when tripled, it gets -0/-X. If one characteristic’s value is negative but the other isn’t when both are tripled, it gets -X/+Y or +X/-Y, as appropriate.
    RULE_701_11_TRIPLE(Condition),

    // 701.12. Exchange
    // 701.12a. A spell or ability may instruct players to exchange something (for example, life totals or control of two permanents) as part of its resolution. When such a spell or ability resolves, if the entire exchange can’t be completed, no part of the exchange occurs.
    // 701.12b. When control of two permanents is exchanged, if those permanents are controlled by different players, each of those players simultaneously gains control of the permanent that was controlled by the other player. If, on the other hand, those permanents are controlled by the same player, the exchange effect does nothing.
    // 701.12c. When life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player’s previous life total. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them. A player who can’t gain life can’t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can’t lose life can’t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7–8).
    // 701.12d. Some spells or abilities may instruct a player to exchange cards in one zone with cards in a different zone (for example, exiled cards and cards in a player’s hand). These spells and abilities work the same as other “exchange” spells and abilities, except they can exchange the cards only if all the cards are owned by the same player, and they can exchange the cards even if one zone is empty.
    // 701.12e. If a card in one zone is exchanged with a card in a different zone, and either of them is attached to an object, that card stops being attached to that object and the other card becomes attached to that object.
    // 701.12f. If a spell or ability instructs a player to simply exchange two zones, and one of the zones is empty, the cards in the zones are still exchanged.
    // 701.12g. A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can’t gain life can’t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can’t lose life can’t be given a lower life total this way (see rules 119.7–8). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule 613.4b). This rule does not apply to spells and abilities that switch a creature’s power and toughness.
    // 701.12h. One card (Exchange of Words) instructs a player to exchange the text boxes of two creatures. This creates a text-changing effect (see rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects”). In such an exchange, the rules text of each permanent becomes the previous rules text of the other.
    RULE_701_12_EXCHANGE(Condition),

    // 701.13. Exile
    // 701.13a. To exile an object, move it to the exile zone from wherever it is. See rule 406, “Exile.”
    RULE_701_13_EXILE,

    // 701.14. Fight
    // 701.14a. A spell or ability may instruct a creature to fight another creature or it may instruct two creatures to fight each other. Each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to the other creature.
    // 701.14b. If one or both creatures instructed to fight are no longer on the battlefield or are no longer creatures, neither of them fights or deals damage. If one or both creatures are illegal targets for a resolving spell or ability that instructs them to fight, neither of them fights or deals damage.
    // 701.14c. If a creature fights itself, it deals damage to itself equal to twice its power.
    // 701.14d. The damage dealt when a creature fights isn’t combat damage.
    RULE_701_14_FIGHT(Condition),

    // 701.15. Goad
    // 701.15a. Certain spells and abilities can goad a creature. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that creature is goaded.
    // 701.15b. Goaded is a designation a permanent can have. A goaded creature attacks each combat if able and attacks a player other than the controller of the permanent, spell, or ability that caused it to be goaded if able. Goaded is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 701.15c. A creature can be goaded by multiple players. Doing so creates additional combat requirements.
    // 701.15d. Once a player has goaded a creature, the same player goading it again has no effect. Doing so doesn’t create additional combat requirements.
    RULE_701_15_GOAD(Condition),

    // 701.16. Investigate
    // 701.16a. “Investigate” means “Create a Clue token.” See rule 111.10f.
    RULE_701_16_INVESTIGATE,

    // 701.17. Mill
    // 701.17a. For a player to mill a number of cards, that player puts that many cards from the top of their library into their graveyard.
    // 701.17b. A player can’t mill a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library. If given the choice to do so, they can’t choose to take that action. If instructed to do so, they mill as many as possible. Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes milling a number of cards greater than the number of cards in their library.
    // 701.17c. An effect that refers to a milled card can find that card in the zone it moved to from the library, as long as that zone is a public zone.
    // 701.17d. Some spells and abilities mill a single card and then ask for information about the milled card. If more than one card is milled due to replacement effects and the effect of a spell or ability asks for information about the milled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets information from each milled card and will get multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that effect grants a player permission to cast or play “that” card, the permission applies to each of the milled cards. If that effect performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each milled card. If that effect performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the spell or ability chooses which card is affected.
    RULE_701_17_MILL(Condition),

    // 701.18. Play
    // 701.18a. To play a land means to put it onto the battlefield from the zone it’s in (usually the hand). A player may play a land if they have priority, it’s the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they haven’t played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule 116), so it doesn’t use the stack; it simply happens. Putting a land onto the battlefield as the result of a spell or ability isn’t the same as playing a land. See rule 305, “Lands.”
    // 701.18b. To play a card means to play that card as a land or to cast that card as a spell, whichever is appropriate.
    // 701.18c. Some effects instruct a player to “play” with a certain aspect of the game changed, such as “Play with the top card of your library revealed.” “Play” in this sense means to play the Magic game.
    // 701.18d. Previously, the action of casting a spell, or casting a card as a spell, was referred to on cards as “playing” that spell or that card. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “casting” that spell or that card.
    // 701.18e. Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.
    RULE_701_18_PLAY(Condition),

    // 701.19. Regenerate
    // 701.19a. If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and its controller taps it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”
    // 701.19b. If the effect of a static ability regenerates a permanent, it replaces destruction with an alternate effect each time that permanent would be destroyed. In this case, “Regenerate [permanent]” means “Instead remove all damage marked on [permanent] and its controller taps it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”
    // 701.19c. Neither activating an ability that creates a regeneration shield nor casting a spell that creates a regeneration shield is the same as regenerating a permanent. Effects that say that a permanent can’t be regenerated don’t preclude such abilities from being activated or such spells from being cast; rather, they cause regeneration shields to not be applied.
    RULE_701_19_EFFECT_RESOLVING_SPELL_ABILITY_REGENERATES(Condition),

    // 701.20. Reveal
    // 701.20a. To reveal a card, show that card to all players for a brief time. If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, or if a card is revealed because an ability is activated from a hidden zone (see rule 602.2a), the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack. If revealing a card causes a triggered ability to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered ability leaves the stack. If that ability isn’t put onto the stack the next time a player would receive priority, the card ceases to be revealed.
    // 701.20b. Revealing a card doesn’t cause it to leave the zone it’s in.
    // 701.20c. A card that is currently revealed may be revealed again.
    // 701.20d. If cards in a player’s library are shuffled or otherwise reordered, any revealed cards that are reordered stop being revealed and become new objects.
    // 701.20e. Some effects instruct a player to look at one or more cards. Looking at a card follows the same rules as revealing a card, except that the card is shown only to the specified player.
    RULE_701_20_REVEAL(Condition),

    // 701.21. Sacrifice
    // 701.21a. To sacrifice a permanent, its controller moves it from the battlefield directly to its owner’s graveyard. A player can’t sacrifice something that isn’t a permanent, or something that’s a permanent they don’t control. Sacrificing a permanent doesn’t destroy it, so regeneration or other effects that replace destruction can’t affect this action.
    RULE_701_21_SACRIFICE,

    // 701.22. Scry
    // 701.22a. To “scry N” means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order and the rest on top of your library in any order.
    // 701.22b. If a player is instructed to scry 0, no scry event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player scries won’t trigger.
    // 701.22c. If multiple players scry at once, each of those players looks at the top cards of their library at the same time. Those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.
    // 701.22d. An ability that triggers whenever a player scries triggers after the process described in rule 701.22a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    RULE_701_22_SCRY(Condition),

    // 701.23. Search
    // 701.23a. To search for a card in a zone, look at all cards in that zone (even if it’s a hidden zone) and find a card that matches the given description.
    // 701.23b. If a player is searching a hidden zone for cards with a stated quality, such as a card with a certain card type or color, that player isn’t required to find some or all of those cards even if they’re present in that zone.
    // 701.23c. If a player is instructed to search a hidden zone for cards that match an undefined quality, that player may still search that zone but can’t find any cards.
    // 701.23d. If a player is searching a hidden zone simply for a quantity of cards, such as “a card” or “three cards,” that player must find that many cards (or as many as possible, if the zone doesn’t contain enough cards).
    // 701.23e. If the effect that contains the search instruction doesn’t also contain instructions to reveal the found card(s), then they’re not revealed.
    // 701.23f. If searching a zone is replaced with searching a portion of that zone, any other instructions that refer to searching the zone still apply. Any abilities that trigger on a library being searched will trigger.
    // 701.23g. If an effect offers a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found, that player may choose to search even if the additional actions are illegal or impossible.
    // 701.23h. An effect may instruct a player to search a library for one or more cards more than once before instructing a player to shuffle that library. This is the same as a single instruction for that player to search that library for all those cards. The player searches that library only once.
    // 701.23i. If multiple players search at once, each of those players looks at the appropriate cards at the same time, then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) which card to find.
    // 701.23j. If an effect instructs a player to search outside the game for a card, that player may choose an appropriate card they own from outside the game.
    RULE_701_23_SEARCH(Condition),

    // 701.24. Shuffle
    // 701.24a. To shuffle a library or a face-down pile of cards, randomize the cards within it so that no player knows their order.
    // 701.24b. Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put some or all of the found cards into a different zone or in a certain position in that library. In such cases, the found cards aren’t included in the shuffle, even though they remain in the library at that time. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled. Abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger. See also rule 401, “Library.”
    // 701.24c. If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they’re expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.
    // 701.24d. If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a set of objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if there are no objects in that set.
    // 701.24e. If an effect causes a player to shuffle a library containing zero or one cards, abilities that trigger when a library is shuffled will still trigger.
    // 701.24f. If two or more effects cause a library to be shuffled multiple times simultaneously, abilities that trigger when that library is shuffled will trigger that many times.
    // 701.24g. If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library that’s randomized except that the object is in the specified position.
    RULE_701_24_SHUFFLE(Condition),

    // 701.25. Surveil
    // 701.25a. To “surveil N” means to look at the top N cards of your library, then put any number of them into your graveyard and the rest on top of your library in any order.
    // 701.25b. If an effect allows you to look at additional cards while you surveil, those cards are included among the cards you may put into your graveyard and on top of your library in any order.
    // 701.25c. If a player is instructed to surveil 0, no surveil event occurs. Abilities that trigger whenever a player surveils won’t trigger.
    // 701.25d. An ability that triggers whenever a player surveils triggers after the process described in rule 701.25a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    RULE_701_25_SURVEIL(Condition),

    // 701.26. Tap and Untap
    // 701.26a. To tap a permanent, turn it sideways from an upright position. Only untapped permanents can be tapped.
    // 701.26b. To untap a permanent, rotate it back to the upright position from a sideways position. Only tapped permanents can be untapped.
    RULE_701_26_TAP_UNTAP,

    // 701.27. Transform
    // 701.27a. To transform a permanent, turn it over so that its other face is up. Only permanents represented by double-faced tokens and double-faced cards can transform. (See rule 712, “Double-Faced Cards.”)
    // 701.27b. Although transforming a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down won’t trigger when that permanent transforms, and so on.
    // 701.27c. If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent that isn’t represented by a double-faced token or a double-faced card, nothing happens.
    // 701.27d. If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform into is an instant or sorcery face nothing happens.
    // 701.27e. Some triggered abilities trigger when an object “transforms into” an object with a specified characteristic. Such an ability triggers if the object either transforms or converts (see rule 701.28) and has the specified characteristic immediately after it does so.
    // 701.27f. If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isn’t a delayed triggered ability of that permanent tries to transform it, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t transformed or converted since the ability was put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t transformed or converted since that delayed triggered ability was created. In both cases, if the permanent has already transformed or converted, an instruction to do either is ignored.
    // 701.27g. Some spells and abilities refer to a “transformed permanent.” This phrase refers to a double-faced permanent on the battlefield with its back face up. A permanent with its front face up is never considered a transformed permanent, even if it had its back face up previously. Similarly, an object represented by more than one card, such as a melded or merged permanent, is never considered a transformed permanent, even if it has components that are back face up. See rules 701.42, “Meld,” and 730, “Merging with Permanents.”
    RULE_701_27_TRANSFORM(Condition),

    // 701.28. Convert
    // 701.28a. To convert a permanent, turn it so that its other face is up. This follows rules 701.27a–f, 712.9–10, and 712.18. Those rules apply to converting a permanent just as they apply to transforming a permanent.
    // 701.28b. Although converting a permanent uses the same physical action as turning a permanent face up or face down, they are different game actions. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face down won’t trigger when that permanent converts, and so on.
    // 701.28c. If a spell or ability instructs a player to convert a permanent that isn’t represented by a double-faced token or a double-faced card, nothing happens.
    // 701.28d. If a spell or ability instructs a player to convert a permanent, and the face that permanent would convert into is an instant or sorcery face, nothing happens.
    // 701.28e. If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isn’t a delayed triggered ability of that permanent tries to convert it, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t converted or transformed since the ability was put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to convert that permanent, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t converted or transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created. In both cases, if the permanent has already transformed or converted, an instruction to do either is ignored.
    // 701.28f. If a spell or ability states that a permanent can’t transform, that permanent also can’t convert.
    RULE_701_28_CONVERT(Condition),

    // 701.29. Fateseal
    // 701.29a. To “fateseal N” means to look at the top N cards of an opponent’s library, then put any number of them on the bottom of that library in any order and the rest on top of that library in any order.
    RULE_701_29_FATESEAL(Condition),

    // 701.30. Clash
    // 701.30a. To clash, a player reveals the top card of their library. That player may then put that card on the bottom of their library.
    // 701.30b. “Clash with an opponent” means “Choose an opponent. You and that opponent each clash.”
    // 701.30c. Each clashing player reveals the top card of their library at the same time. Then those players decide in APNAP order (see rule 101.4) where to put those cards, then those cards move at the same time.
    // 701.30d. A player wins a clash if that player revealed a card with a higher mana value than all other cards revealed in that clash.
    RULE_701_30_CLASH(Condition),

    // 701.31. Planeswalk
    // 701.31a. A player may planeswalk only during a Planechase game. Only the planar controller may planeswalk. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    // 701.31b. To planeswalk is to put each face-up plane card and phenomenon card on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up.
    // 701.31c. A player may planeswalk as the result of the “planeswalking ability” (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon’s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.
    // 701.31d. The plane card that’s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card that’s turned face down or that leaves the game is the plane the player planeswalks away from. The same is true with respect to phenomena.
    RULE_701_31_PLANESWALK,

    // 701.32. Set in Motion
    // 701.32a. Only a scheme card may be set in motion, and only during an Archenemy game. Only the archenemy may set a scheme card in motion. See rule 314, “Schemes,” and rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    // 701.32b. To set a scheme in motion, move it off the top of your scheme deck if it’s on top of your scheme deck and turn it face up if it isn’t face up. That scheme is considered to have been set in motion even if neither of these actions was performed on it.
    // 701.32c. Schemes may only be set in motion one at a time. If a player is instructed to set multiple schemes in motion, that player sets a scheme in motion that many times.
    RULE_701_32_SET_MOTION(Condition),

    // 701.33. Abandon
    // 701.33a. Only a face-up ongoing scheme card may be abandoned, and only during an Archenemy game. See rule 314, “Schemes,” and rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    // 701.33b. To abandon a scheme, turn it face down and put it on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck.
    RULE_701_33_ABANDON,

    // 701.34. Proliferate
    // 701.34a. To proliferate means to choose any number of permanents and/or players that have a counter, then give each one additional counter of each kind that permanent or player already has.
    // 701.34b. In a Two-Headed Giant game, poison counters are shared by the team. If more than one player on a team is chosen this way, only one of those players can be given an additional poison counter. The player who proliferates chooses which player that is. See rule 810, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”
    RULE_701_34_PROLIFERATE(Condition),

    // 701.35. Detain
    // 701.35a. Certain spells and abilities can detain a permanent. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that permanent can’t attack or block and its activated abilities can’t be activated.
    RULE_701_35_DETAIN,

    // 701.36. Populate
    // 701.36a. To populate means to choose a creature token you control and create a token that’s a copy of that creature token.
    // 701.36b. If you control no creature tokens when instructed to populate, you won’t create a token.
    RULE_701_36_POPULATE(Condition),

    // 701.37. Monstrosity
    // 701.37a. “Monstrosity N” means “If this permanent isn’t monstrous, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes monstrous.”
    // 701.37b. Monstrous is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the monstrosity action and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become monstrous. Once a permanent becomes monstrous, it stays monstrous until it leaves the battlefield. Monstrous is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 701.37c. If a permanent’s ability instructs a player to “monstrosity X,” other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X as that permanent became monstrous.
    RULE_701_37_MONSTROSITY(Condition),

    // 701.38. Vote
    // 701.38a. Some spells and abilities instruct players to vote for one choice from a list of options to determine some aspect of the effect of that spell or ability. To vote, each player, starting with a specified player and proceeding in turn order, chooses one of those choices.
    // 701.38b. The listed choices may be objects, words with no rules meaning that are each connected to a different effect, or other variables relevant to the resolution of the spell or ability.
    // 701.38c. If the text of a spell or ability refers to “voting,” it refers only to an actual vote, not to any spell or ability that involves the players making choices or decisions without using the word “vote.”
    // 701.38d. If an effect gives a player multiple votes, those votes all happen at the same time the player would otherwise have voted.
    RULE_701_38_VOTE(Condition),

    // 701.39. Bolster
    // 701.39a. “Bolster N” means “Choose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.”
    RULE_701_39_BOLSTER,

    // 701.40. Manifest
    // 701.40a. To manifest a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a manifested permanent for as long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the card is face down and ends when it’s turned face up.
    // 701.40b. Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what that card’s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isn’t a creature card or it doesn’t have a mana cost, it can’t be turned face up this way.)
    // 701.40c. If a card with morph is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.37e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.
    // 701.40d. If a card with disguise is manifested, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.168d to turn a face-down permanent with disguise face up or the procedure described above to turn a manifested permanent face up.
    // 701.40e. If an effect instructs a player to manifest multiple cards from their library, those cards are manifested one at a time.
    // 701.40f. If an effect instructs a player to manifest a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down object from entering the battlefield, that card isn’t manifested. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it remains in its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.
    // 701.40g. If a manifested permanent that’s represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won’t trigger.
    // 701.40h. See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” for more information.
    RULE_701_40_MANIFEST(Condition),

    // 701.41. Support
    // 701.41a. “Support N” on a permanent means “Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N other target creatures.” “Support N” on an instant or sorcery spell means “Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N target creatures.”
    RULE_701_41_SUPPORT,

    // 701.42. Meld
    // 701.42a. Meld is a keyword action that appears in an ability on one card in a meld pair. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined. The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards. See rule 712, “Double-Faced Cards.”
    // 701.42b. Only two cards belonging to the same meld pair can be melded. Tokens, cards that aren’t meld cards, or meld cards that don’t form a meld pair can’t be melded.
    // 701.42c. If an effect instructs a player to meld objects that can’t be melded, they stay in their current zone.
    RULE_701_42_MELD(Condition),

    // 701.43. Exert
    // 701.43a. To exert a permanent, you choose to have it not untap during your next untap step.
    // 701.43b. A permanent can be exerted even if it’s not tapped or has already been exerted in a turn. If you exert a permanent more than once before your next untap step, each effect causing it not to untap expires during the same untap step.
    // 701.43c. An object that isn’t on the battlefield can’t be exerted.
    // 701.43d. “You may exert [this creature] as it attacks” is an optional cost to attack (see rule 508.1g). Some objects with this static ability have a triggered ability that triggers “when you do” printed in the same paragraph. These abilities are linked. (See rule 607.2h.)
    RULE_701_43_EXERT(Condition),

    // 701.44. Explore
    // 701.44a. Certain spells and abilities instruct a permanent to explore. To do so, that permanent’s controller reveals the top card of their library. If a land card is revealed this way, that player puts that card into their hand. Otherwise, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the exploring permanent and may put the revealed card into their graveyard.
    // 701.44b. A permanent “explores” after the process described in rule 701.44a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    // 701.44c. If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to explore, its last known information is used to determine which object explored and who controlled it.
    // 701.44d. If multiple permanents are instructed to explore at the same time, the first player in APNAP order who controls (or, in the case of a permanent no longer on the battlefield, last controlled; see rule 701.44c) one or more of those permanents chooses one of them and it explores. Then this process is repeated for each remaining instruction to explore.
    RULE_701_44_EXPLORE(Condition),

    // 701.45. Assemble
    // 701.45a. Assemble is a keyword action in the Unstable set that puts Contraptions onto the battlefield. Outside of silver-bordered cards, only one card (Steamflogger Boss) refers to assembling a Contraption. Cards and mechanics from the Unstable set aren’t included in these rules. See the Unstable FAQ for more information.
    RULE_701_45_ASSEMBLE,

    // 701.46. Adapt
    // 701.46a. “Adapt N” means “If this permanent has no +1/+1 counters on it, put N +1/+1 counters on it.”
    RULE_701_46_ADAPT(Condition),

    // 701.47. Amass
    // 701.47a. To amass [subtype] N means “If you don’t control an Army creature, create a 0/0 black [subtype] Army creature token. Choose an Army creature you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature. If it isn’t a [subtype], it becomes a [subtype] in addition to its other types.”
    // 701.47b. A player “amassed” after the process described in rule 701.47a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    // 701.47c. The phrases “the Army you amassed” and “the amassed Army” refer to the creature you chose, whether or not it received counters.
    // 701.47d. Some older cards were printed with amass N without including a subtype. Those cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference so that they read “amass Zombies N.”
    RULE_701_47_AMASS(Condition),

    // 701.48. Learn
    // 701.48a. “Learn” means “You may discard a card. If you do, draw a card. If you didn’t discard a card, you may reveal a Lesson card you own from outside the game and put it into your hand.”
    RULE_701_48_LEARN(Condition),

    // 701.49. Venture into the Dungeon
    // 701.49a. If a player is instructed to venture into the dungeon while they don’t own a dungeon card in the command zone, they choose a dungeon card they own from outside the game and put it into the command zone. They put their venture marker on the topmost room. See rule 309, “Dungeons.”
    // 701.49b. If a player is instructed to venture into the dungeon while their venture marker is in any room except a dungeon card’s bottommost room, they choose an adjacent room, following the direction of an arrow pointing away from their current room. If there are multiple arrows pointing away from the room the player’s venture marker is in, they choose one of them to follow. They move their venture marker to that adjacent room.
    // 701.49c. If a player is instructed to venture into the dungeon while their venture marker is in the bottommost room of a dungeon card, they remove that dungeon card from the game. Doing so causes the player to complete that dungeon (see rule 309.7). They then choose an appropriate dungeon card they own from outside the game, put it into the command zone, and put their venture marker on the topmost room of that dungeon.
    // 701.49d. Venture into [quality] is a variant of venture into the dungeon. If a player is instructed to “venture into [quality]” while they don’t own a dungeon card in the command zone, they choose a dungeon card they own from outside the game with the indicated quality and put it into the command zone. They put their venture marker on the topmost room of that dungeon. If they already own a dungeon card in the command zone, they follow the normal procedure for venturing into the dungeon outlined in 701.49b–c.
    RULE_701_49_VENTURE_INTO_DUNGEON(Condition),

    // 701.50. Connive
    // 701.50a. Certain spells and abilities instruct a permanent to connive. To do so, that permanent’s controller draws a card, then discards a card. If a nonland card is discarded this way, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the conniving permanent.
    // 701.50b. A permanent “connives” after the process described in rule 701.50a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    // 701.50c. If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to connive, its last known information is used to determine which object connived and who controlled it.
    // 701.50d. If multiple permanents are instructed to connive at the same time, the first player in APNAP order who controls (or, in the case of a permanent no longer on the battlefield, last controlled; see rule 701.50c) one or more of those permanents chooses one of them and it connives. Then this process is repeated for each remaining instruction to connive.
    // 701.50e. Connive N is a variant of connive. The permanent’s controller draws N cards, discards N cards, then puts a number of +1/+1 counters on the permanent equal to the number of nonland cards discarded this way.
    RULE_701_50_CONNIVE(Condition),

    // 701.51. Open an Attraction
    // 701.51a. A player may open an Attraction only during a game in which that player is playing with an Attraction deck (see rule 717, “Attraction Cards”).
    // 701.51b. To open an Attraction, move the top card of your Attraction deck off the Attraction deck, turn it face up, and put it onto the battlefield under your control.
    // 701.51c. An ability which triggers whenever a player opens an Attraction triggers when that player puts an Attraction card onto the battlefield while performing the instruction in the above rule. If an effect prevents that Attraction from entering the battlefield or replaces entering the battlefield with another event, that ability doesn’t trigger.
    RULE_701_51_OPEN_ATTRACTION(Condition),

    // 701.52. Roll to Visit Your Attractions
    // 701.52a. To roll to visit your Attractions, roll a six-sided die. Then if you control one or more Attractions with a number lit up that is equal to that result, each of those Attractions has been “visited” and its visit ability triggers. See rule 717, “Attraction Cards,” and rule 702.159, “Visit.”

    // 701.53. Incubate
    // 701.53a. To incubate N, create an Incubator token that enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it. See rule 111.10i.
    // 701.53b. An Incubator token is a double-faced token. Its front face is a colorless Incubator artifact with “{2}: Transform this token.” Its back face is a 0/0 colorless Phyrexian artifact creature named “Phyrexian Token.”
    RULE_701_53_INCUBATE,

    // 701.54. The Ring Tempts You
    // 701.54a. Certain spells and abilities have the text “the Ring tempts you.” Each time the Ring tempts you, choose a creature you control. That creature becomes your Ring-bearer until another creature becomes your Ring-bearer or another player gains control of it.
    // 701.54b. Ring-bearer is a designation a permanent can have. Being a Ring-bearer is not a copiable value.
    // 701.54c. If a player doesn’t have an emblem named The Ring at the time the Ring tempts them, they get an emblem named The Ring before choosing a creature to be their Ring-bearer. The Ring has “Your Ring-bearer is legendary and can’t be blocked by creatures with greater power.” As long as the Ring has tempted that player two or more times, it has “Whenever your Ring-bearer attacks, draw a card, then discard a card.” As long as the Ring has tempted that player three or more times, it has “Whenever your Ring-bearer becomes blocked by a creature, the blocking creature’s controller sacrifices it at end of combat.” As long as the Ring has tempted that player four or more times, it has “Whenever your Ring-bearer deals combat damage to a player, each opponent loses 3 life.”
    // 701.54d. Some abilities trigger “Whenever the Ring tempts you.” The Ring tempts a player whenever they complete the actions in 701.54a, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    // 701.54e. Some abilities check to see if a creature “is your Ring-bearer.” For the purposes of those abilities, that condition is true if that creature is on the battlefield under your control and has the Ring-bearer designation.
    RULE_701_54_RING_TEMPTS(Condition),

    // 701.55. Face a Villainous Choice
    // 701.55a. “[A player] faces a villainous choice — [option A], or [option B]” means “[A player] chooses [option A] or [option B]. Then all actions in the chosen option are performed.”
    // 701.55b. While facing a villainous choice, a player may choose an option that is illegal or impossible. In that case, they perform as much of the action as is possible. This is an exception to rule 608.2d.
    // 701.55c. A replacement effect may replace an instruction to face a villainous choice with an instruction to face that choice some number of additional times. In that case, the entire process described in rule 701.55a is performed for that player the appropriate number of times one at a time.
    // 701.55d. If more than one player is instructed to face a villainous choice, the entire process described in rule 701.55a is performed for each of those players one at a time in APNAP order. This is an exception to rule 608.2e.

To time travel means to choose any number of permanents you control with one or more time counters on them and/or suspended cards you own in exile with one or more time counters on them and, for each of those objects, put a time counter on it or remove a time counter from it. See rule 702.62, “Suspend.”
    RULE_701_56_TIME_TRAVEL,

    // 701.57. Discover
    // 701.57a. “Discover N” means “Exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card with mana value N or less. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost if the resulting spell’s mana value is less than or equal to N. If you don’t cast it, put that card into your hand. Put the remaining exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.”
    // 701.57b. A player has “discovered” after the process described in 701.57a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    // 701.57c. If the final card exiled during the process described in rule 701.57a has mana value N or less, it is the “discovered card,” regardless of whether it was cast or put into a player’s hand.
    RULE_701_57_DISCOVER(Condition),

    // 701.58. Cloak
    // 701.58a. To cloak a card, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with ward {2}, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Put that card onto the battlefield face down. That permanent is a cloaked permanent for as long as it remains face down. The effect defining its characteristics works while the card is face down and ends when it’s turned face up.
    // 701.58b. Any time you have priority, you may turn a cloaked permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116.2b). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what that card’s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isn’t a creature card or it doesn’t have a mana cost, it can’t be turned face up this way.)
    // 701.58c. If a card with morph is cloaked, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.37e to turn a face-down permanent with morph face up or the procedure described above to turn a cloaked permanent face up.
    // 701.58d. If a card with disguise is cloaked, its controller may turn that card face up using either the procedure described in rule 702.168d to turn a face-down permanent with disguise face up or the procedure described above to turn a cloaked permanent face up.
    // 701.58e. If an effect instructs a player to cloak multiple cards from a single library, those cards are cloaked one at a time.
    // 701.58f. If an effect instructs a player to cloak a card and a rule or effect prohibits the face-down object from entering the battlefield, that card isn’t cloaked. Its characteristics remain unmodified and it remains in its previous zone. If it was face up, it remains face up.
    // 701.58g. If a cloaked permanent that’s represented by an instant or sorcery card would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger whenever a permanent is turned face up won’t trigger.
    // 701.58h. See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” for more information.
    RULE_701_58_CLOAK(Condition),

    // 701.59. Collect Evidence
    // 701.59a. To “collect evidence N” means to exile any number of cards from your graveyard with total mana value N or greater.
    // 701.59b. If a player is given the choice to collect evidence but is unable to exile cards with total mana value N or greater from their graveyard (usually because there aren’t enough cards to do so) they can’t choose to collect evidence.
    // 701.59c. A spell that has an ability that allows a player to collect evidence as an additional cost to cast it may have another ability that refers to whether evidence was collected. These abilities are linked. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”
    RULE_701_59_COLLECT_EVIDENCE(Condition),

    // 701.60. Suspect
    // 701.60a. Certain spells and abilities instruct a player to suspect a creature. That creature becomes suspected until it leaves the battlefield or until a spell or ability causes it to no longer be suspected.
    // 701.60b. Suspected is a designation a permanent can have. Only permanents can have the suspected designation. Suspected is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 701.60c. A suspected permanent has menace and “This creature can’t block” for as long as it’s suspected.
    // 701.60d. A suspected permanent can’t become suspected again.
    RULE_701_60_SUSPECT,

    RULE_701_61_FORAGE,

    // 701.62. Manifest Dread
    // 701.62a. “Manifest dread” means “Look at the top two cards of your library. Manifest one of them, then put the cards you looked at that were not manifested this way into your graveyard.” See rule 701.40, “Manifest.”
    // 701.62b. An ability that triggers whenever a player manifests dread triggers after the process described in rule 701.62a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.
    RULE_701_62_MANIFEST_DREAD(Condition),

    // 701.63. Endure
    // 701.63a. Certain abilities instruct a permanent to endure N. To do so, that permanent’s controller creates an N/N white Spirit creature token unless they put N +1/+1 counters on that permanent.
    // 701.63b. If a permanent is instructed to endure 0, nothing happens. No counters are put on that permanent and no tokens are created.
    RULE_701_63_ENDURE(Condition),

    // 701.64. Harness
    // 701.64a. “Harness [this permanent]” means “If this permanent isn’t harnessed, it becomes harnessed.”
    // 701.64b. Harnessed is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become harnessed. Once a permanent becomes harnessed, it stays harnessed until it leaves the battlefield. Harnessed is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    RULE_701_64_HARNESS(Condition),

    // 701.65. Airbend
    // 701.65a. Certain spells and abilities instruct a player to airbend one or more permanents and/or spells. To do so, that player exiles those objects. For each card exiled this way, for as long as it remains exiled, its owner may cast it by paying {2} rather than paying its mana cost.
    // 701.65b. An ability that triggers whenever a player airbends triggers when that player exiles one or more objects as a result of an instruction to airbend.
    RULE_701_65_AIRBEND(Condition),

    // 701.66. Earthbend
    // 701.66a. “Earthbend N” means “Target land you control becomes a 0/0 land creature with haste in addition to its other types. Put N +1/+1 counters on it. When that land dies or is put into exile, return it to the battlefield tapped under your control.”
    // 701.66b. An ability that triggers whenever a player earthbends triggers when the delayed triggered ability described in rule 701.66a is created.
    RULE_701_66_EARTHBEND(Condition),

    // 701.67. Waterbend
    // 701.67a. “Waterbend [cost]” means “Pay [cost]. For each generic mana in that cost, you may tap an untapped artifact or creature you control rather than pay that mana.”
    // 701.67b. If a waterbend cost is part of the total cost to cast a spell or activate an ability (usually because the waterbend cost itself is an additional cost), the alternate method to pay for mana described in rule 701.67a may be used only to pay for the amount of generic mana in the waterbend cost, even if the total cost to cast that spell or activate that ability includes other generic mana components.
    // 701.67c. An ability that triggers whenever a player waterbends triggers whenever that player pays a waterbend cost, regardless of how they paid that cost.
    RULE_701_67_WATERBEND(Condition),

    // 701.68. Blight
    // 701.68a. To “blight N” means to put N -1/-1 counters on a creature you control.
    // 701.68b. If a player is given the choice to blight but is unable to put N -1/-1 counters on a creature they control (usually because they control no creatures), they can’t choose to blight.
    // 701.68c. Some spells and abilities that instruct a player to blight refer to the “blighted creature.” This phrase refers to the object that the player who was instructed to blight chose to put -1/-1 counters on when blighting.
    // 701.68d. An ability that triggers whenever a player blights triggers after the process described in rule 701.68a is complete, regardless of what events actually occurred.
    RULE_701_68_BLIGHT(Condition),

    // 702.1. Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card’s rules text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule.
    // 702.1a. If an effect refers to a “[keyword ability] cost,” it refers only to the variable costs for that keyword.
    // 702.1b. An effect that grants an object a keyword ability may define a variable in that ability based on characteristics of that object or other information about the game state. For these abilities, the value of that variable is constantly reevaluated.
    // 702.1c. An effect may state that “the same is true for” a list of keyword abilities or similar. If one of those keyword abilities has variants or variables and the effect grants that keyword or counters of that keyword to one or more objects and/or players, it grants each appropriate variant and variable of that keyword.
    // 702.1d. An effect may refer to an object “with [keyword ability]” or “that has [keyword ability].” This means the same thing as an object “with a [keyword ability] ability” or an object “that has a [keyword ability] ability.”
    RULE_702_1_ABILITIES_EXACTLY_CARDS_TEXT_COMMON(Condition),

    // 702.2. Deathtouch
    // 702.2a. Deathtouch is a static ability.
    // 702.2b. A creature with toughness greater than 0 that’s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked is destroyed as a state-based action. See rule 704.
    // 702.2c. Any nonzero amount of combat damage assigned to a creature by a source with deathtouch is considered to be lethal damage for the purposes of determining if excess damage is being dealt.
    // 702.2d. The deathtouch rules function no matter what zone an object with deathtouch deals damage from.
    // 702.2e. If an object changes zones before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had deathtouch.
    // 702.2f. Multiple instances of deathtouch on the same object are redundant.
    RULE_702_2_DEATHTOUCH(Condition),

    // 702.3. Defender
    // 702.3a. Defender is a static ability.

    RULE_702_3_DEFENDER,

    // 702.4. Double Strike
    // 702.4a. Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”)
    // 702.4b. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule 702.7) or double strike as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.
    // 702.4c. Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat damage step will stop it from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.
    // 702.4d. Giving double strike to a creature with first strike after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step will allow the creature to assign combat damage in the second combat damage step.
    // 702.4e. Multiple instances of double strike on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_4_DOUBLE_STRIKE(Condition),

    // 702.5. Enchant
    // 702.5a. Enchant is a static ability, written “Enchant [object or player].” The enchant ability restricts what an Aura spell can target and what an Aura can enchant.
    // 702.5b. For more information about Auras, see rule 303, “Enchantments.”
    // 702.5c. If an Aura has multiple instances of enchant, all of them apply. The Aura’s target must follow the restrictions from all the instances of enchant. The Aura can enchant only objects or players that match all of its enchant abilities.
    // 702.5d. Auras that can enchant a player can target and be attached to players. Such Auras can’t target permanents and can’t be attached to permanents.
    RULE_702_5_ENCHANT(Condition),

    // 702.6. Equip
    // 702.6a. Equip is an activated ability of Equipment cards. “Equip [cost]” means “[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target creature you control. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    // 702.6b. For more information about Equipment, see rule 301, “Artifacts.”
    // 702.6c. Equip abilities may further restrict what creatures may be chosen as legal targets. Such restrictions usually appear in the form “Equip [quality]” or “Equip [quality] creature.” These equip abilities may legally target only a creature that’s controlled by the player activating the ability and that has the chosen quality. Additional restrictions for an equip ability don’t restrict what the Equipment may be attached to.
    // 702.6d. If a permanent has multiple equip abilities, any of its equip abilities may be activated.
    // 702.6e. “Equip planeswalker” is a variant of the equip ability. “Equip planeswalker [cost]” means “[Cost]: Attach this permanent to target planeswalker you control as though that planeswalker were a creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    RULE_702_6_EQUIP(Condition),

    // 702.7. First Strike
    // 702.7a. First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step. (See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”)
    // 702.7b. If at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike (see rule 702.4) as the combat damage step begins, the only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are those with first strike or double strike. After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike. After that step, the phase proceeds to the end of combat step.
    // 702.7c. Giving first strike to a creature without it after combat damage has already been dealt in the first combat damage step won’t preclude that creature from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step. Removing first strike from a creature after it has already dealt combat damage in the first combat damage step won’t allow it to also assign combat damage in the second combat damage step (unless the creature has double strike).
    // 702.7d. Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_7_STRIKE(Condition),

    // 702.8. Flash
    // 702.8a. Flash is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on. “Flash” means “You may play this card any time you could cast an instant.”

    // 702.10c. If a creature has haste, its controller can activate its activated abilities whose cost includes the tap symbol or the untap symbol even if that creature hasn’t been controlled by that player continuously since their most recent turn began. (See rule 302.6.)
    // 702.10d. Multiple instances of haste on the same creature are redundant.

    // 702.11. Hexproof
    // 702.11a. Hexproof is a static ability.
    // 702.11b. “Hexproof” on a permanent means “This permanent can’t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.”
    // 702.11c. “Hexproof” on a player means “You can’t be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.”
    // 702.11d. “Hexproof from [quality]” is a variant of the hexproof ability. “Hexproof from [quality]” on a permanent means “This permanent can’t be the target of [quality] spells your opponents control or abilities your opponents control from [quality] sources.” A “hexproof from [quality]” ability is a hexproof ability.
    // 702.11e. Any effect that causes an object to lose hexproof will cause an object to lose all “hexproof from [quality]” abilities. Any effect that allows a player to choose a creature with hexproof as a target as though it didn’t have hexproof will allow a player to choose a creature with a “hexproof from [quality]” ability. Any effect that looks for a card with hexproof will find a card with a “hexproof from [quality]” ability.
    // 702.11f. “Hexproof from [quality A] and from [quality B]” is shorthand for “hexproof from [quality A]” and “hexproof from [quality B]”; it behaves as two separate hexproof abilities.
    // 702.11g. “Hexproof from each [characteristic]” is shorthand for “hexproof from [quality A],” “hexproof from [quality B],” and so on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it behaves as multiple separate hexproof abilities.

    RULE_702_15_LIFELINK(Condition),

    // 702.16. Protection
    // 702.16a. Protection is a static ability, written “Protection from [quality].” This quality is usually a color (as in “protection from black”) but can be any characteristic value or information. If the quality happens to be a card name, it is treated as such only if the protection ability specifies that the quality is a name. If the quality is a card type, subtype, or supertype, the ability applies to sources that are permanents with that card type, subtype, or supertype and to any sources not on the battlefield that are of that card type, subtype, or supertype. This is an exception to rule 109.2.
    // 702.16b. A permanent or player with protection can’t be targeted by spells with the stated quality and can’t be targeted by abilities from a source with the stated quality.
    // 702.16c. A permanent or player with protection can’t be enchanted by Auras that have the stated quality. Such Auras attached to the permanent or player with protection will be put into their owners’ graveyards as a state-based action. (See rule 704, “State-Based Actions.”)
    // 702.16d. A permanent with protection can’t be equipped by Equipment that have the stated quality or fortified by Fortifications that have the stated quality. Such Equipment or Fortifications become unattached from that permanent as a state-based action, but remain on the battlefield. (See rule 704, “State-Based Actions.”)
    // 702.16e. Any damage that would be dealt by sources that have the stated quality to a permanent or player with protection is prevented.
    // 702.16f. Attacking creatures with protection can’t be blocked by creatures that have the stated quality.
    // 702.16g. “Protection from [quality A] and from [quality B]” is shorthand for “protection from [quality A]” and “protection from [quality B]”; it behaves as two separate protection abilities.
    // 702.16h. “Protection from each [characteristic]” is shorthand for “protection from [quality A],” “protection from [quality B],” and so on for each possible quality the listed characteristic could have; it behaves as multiple separate protection abilities.
    // 702.16i. “Protection from each [set of characteristics, qualities, or players]” is shorthand for “protection from [A],” “protection from [B],” and so on for each characteristic, quality, or player in the set. It behaves as multiple separate protection abilities.
    // 702.16j. “Protection from everything” is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent or player with protection from everything has protection from each object regardless of that object’s characteristic values. Such a permanent or player can’t be targeted by spells or abilities and can’t be enchanted by Auras. Such a permanent can’t be equipped by Equipment, fortified by Fortifications, or blocked by creatures. All damage that would be dealt to such a permanent or player is prevented.
    // 702.16k. “Protection from [a player]” is a variant of the protection ability. A permanent or player with protection from a specific player has protection from each object that player controls and protection from each object that player owns not controlled by another player, regardless of that object’s characteristic values. Such a permanent or player can’t be targeted by spells or abilities the specified player controls and can’t be enchanted by Auras that player controls. Such a permanent can’t be equipped by Equipment that player controls, fortified by Fortifications that player controls, or blocked by creatures that player controls. All damage that would be dealt to such a permanent or player by sources controlled by the specified player or owned by that player but not controlled by another player is prevented.
    // 702.16m. Multiple instances of protection from the same quality on the same permanent or player are redundant.
    // 702.16n. Some Auras both give the enchanted creature protection from a quality and say “this effect doesn’t remove” either that specific Aura or all Auras. This means that the specified Auras aren’t put into their owners’ graveyards as a state-based action. If the creature has other instances of protection from the same quality, those instances affect Auras as normal.
    // 702.16p. One Aura (Benevolent Blessing) gives the enchanted creature protection from a quality and says the effect doesn’t remove certain permanents that are “already attached to” that creature. This means that, when the protection effect starts to apply, any objects with the stated quality that are already attached to that creature (including the Aura giving that creature protection) will not be put into their owners’ graveyards as a state-based action. Other permanents with the stated quality can’t become attached to the creature. If the creature has other instances of protection from the same quality, those instances affect attached permanents as normal.

    // 702.19. Trample
    // 702.19a. Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creature’s combat damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage. (See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”)
    // 702.19b. The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player, planeswalker, or battle the creature is attacking. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. The attacking creature’s controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case can’t assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking.
    // 702.19c. Trample over planeswalkers is a variant of trample that modifies the rules for assigning combat damage to planeswalkers. The controller of a creature with trample over planeswalkers assigns that creature’s combat damage as described in rule 702.19b, with one exception. If that creature is attacking a planeswalker, after lethal damage is assigned to all blocking creatures and damage at least equal to the loyalty of the planeswalker the creature is attacking is assigned to that planeswalker, further excess damage may be assigned as the attacking creature’s controller chooses among those blocking creatures, that planeswalker, and that planeswalker’s controller. When checking for assigned damage equal to a planeswalker’s loyalty, take into account damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt.
    // 702.19d. If an attacking creature with trample or trample over planeswalkers is blocked, but there are no creatures blocking it when damage is assigned, its damage is assigned to the defending player and/or planeswalker as though all blocking creatures have been assigned lethal damage.
    // 702.19e. If a creature with trample over planeswalkers is attacking a planeswalker and that planeswalker is removed from combat, the creature’s damage may be assigned to the defending player once all blocking creatures have been dealt lethal damage or, if there are no blocking creatures when damage is assigned, all its damage is assigned to the defending player. This is an exception to rule 506.4c, and it does not cause the creature to be attacking that player.
    // 702.19f. If a creature without trample over planeswalkers is attacking a planeswalker, none of its combat damage can be assigned to the defending player, even if that planeswalker has been removed from combat or the damage the attacking creature could assign is greater than the planeswalker’s loyalty.

    // 702.20. Vigilance
    // 702.20a. Vigilance is a static ability that modifies the rules for the declare attackers step.
    // 702.20b. Attacking doesn’t cause creatures with vigilance to tap. (See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step.”)

    RULE_702_20_VIGILANCE,

    // 702.21. Ward
    // 702.21a. Ward is a triggered ability. Ward [cost] means “Whenever this permanent becomes the target of a spell or ability an opponent controls, counter that spell or ability unless that player pays [cost].”
    // 702.21b. Some ward abilities include an X in their cost and state what X is equal to. This value is determined at the time the ability resolves, not locked in as the ability triggers.
    RULE_702_21_WARD(Condition),

    // 702.22. Banding
    // 702.22a. Banding is a static ability that modifies the rules for combat.
    // 702.22b. “Bands with other” is a special form of banding. If an effect causes a permanent to lose banding, the permanent loses all “bands with other” abilities as well.
    // 702.22c. As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has “bands with other”) are all in a “band.” They may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with “bands with other [quality]” and any number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them. (Defending players can’t declare bands but may use banding in a different way; see rule 702.22j.)
    // 702.22d. All creatures in an attacking band must attack the same player, planeswalker, or battle.
    // 702.22e. Once an attacking band has been announced, it lasts for the rest of combat, even if something later removes banding or “bands with other” from one or more of the creatures in the band.
    // 702.22f. An attacking creature that’s removed from combat is also removed from the band it was in.
    // 702.22g. Banding doesn’t cause attacking creatures to share abilities, nor does it remove any abilities. The attacking creatures in a band are separate permanents.
    // 702.22h. If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature.
    // 702.22i. If one member of a band would become blocked due to an effect, the entire band becomes blocked.
    // 702.22j. During the combat damage step, if an attacking creature is being blocked by a creature with banding, or by both a [quality] creature with “bands with other [quality]” and another [quality] creature, the defending player (rather than the active player) chooses how the attacking creature’s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature’s combat damage as they choose among any creatures blocking it. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1c.
    // 702.22k. During the combat damage step, if a blocking creature is blocking a creature with banding, or both a [quality] creature with “bands with other [quality]” and another [quality] creature, the active player (rather than the defending player) chooses how the blocking creature’s damage is assigned. That player can divide that creature’s combat damage as they choose among any creatures it’s blocking. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 510.1d.
    // 702.22m. Multiple instances of banding on the same creature are redundant. Multiple instances of “bands with other” of the same kind on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_22_BANDING(Condition),

    // 702.23. Rampage
    // 702.23a. Rampage is a triggered ability. “Rampage N” means “Whenever this creature becomes blocked, it gets +N/+N until end of turn for each creature blocking it beyond the first.” (See rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”)
    // 702.23b. The rampage bonus is calculated only once per combat, when the triggered ability resolves. Adding or removing blockers later in combat won’t change the bonus.
    // 702.23c. If a creature has multiple instances of rampage, each triggers separately.
    RULE_702_23_RAMPAGE(Condition),

    // 702.24. Cumulative Upkeep
    // 702.24a. Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. “Cumulative upkeep [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent is on the battlefield, put an age counter on this permanent. Then you may pay [cost] for each age counter on it. If you don’t, sacrifice it.” If [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none of them is paid. Partial payments aren’t allowed.
    // 702.24b. If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately. However, the age counters are not connected to any particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.
    RULE_702_24_CUMULATIVE_UPKEEP(Condition),

    // 702.25. Flanking
    // 702.25a. Flanking is a triggered ability that triggers during the declare blockers step. (See rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”) “Flanking” means “Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a creature without flanking, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.”
    // 702.25b. If a creature has multiple instances of flanking, each triggers separately.
    RULE_702_25_FLANKING(Condition),

    // 702.26. Phasing
    // 702.26a. Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each player’s untap step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls “phase out.” Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that player’s control “phase in.”
    // 702.26b. If a permanent phases out, its status changes to “phased out.” Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It can’t affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule 506.4.)
    // 702.26c. If a permanent phases in, its status changes to “phased in.” The game once again treats it as though it exists.
    // 702.26d. The phasing event doesn’t actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though it’s treated as though it’s not on the battlefield and not under its controller’s control while it’s phased out. Zone-change triggers don’t trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters and stickers remain on a permanent while it’s phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanent’s history won’t treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller’s control.
    // 702.26e. If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent won’t be included in the set of affected objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also specifically refer to the permanent as phased out.
    // 702.26f. Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once it’s phased in. In particular, effects with “for as long as” durations that track that permanent (see rule 611.2b) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.
    // 702.26g. When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out “indirectly.” An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won’t phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it’s attached to.
    // 702.26h. If an object would simultaneously phase out directly and indirectly, it just phases out indirectly.
    // 702.26i. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out directly will phase in attached to the object or player it was attached to when it phased out, if that object is still in the same zone or that player is still in the game. If not, that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification phases in unattached. State-based actions apply as appropriate. (See rules 704.5m and 704.5n.)
    // 702.26j. Abilities that trigger when a permanent becomes attached or unattached from an object or player don’t trigger when that permanent phases in or out.
    // 702.26k. Phased-out permanents owned by a player who leaves the game also leave the game. This doesn’t cause zone-change abilities to trigger. See rule 800.4.
    // 702.26m. If an effect causes a player to skip their untap step, the phasing event simply doesn’t occur that turn.
    // 702.26n. In a multiplayer game, game rules may cause a phased-out permanent to leave the game or to be exiled once a player leaves the game. (See rules 800.4a and 800.4c.) If a phased-out permanent phased out under the control of a player who has left the game, that permanent phases in during the next untap step after that player’s next turn would have begun.
    // 702.26p. Multiple instances of phasing on the same permanent are redundant.
    RULE_702_26_PHASING_MECHANICS(Condition),

    // 702.27. Buyback
    // 702.27a. Buyback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities that function while the spell is on the stack. “Buyback [cost]” means “You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell” and “If the buyback cost was paid, put this spell into its owner’s hand instead of into that player’s graveyard as it resolves.” Paying a spell’s buyback cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_27_BUYBACK(Condition),

    // 702.28. Shadow
    // 702.28a. Shadow is an evasion ability.
    // 702.28b. A creature with shadow can’t be blocked by creatures without shadow, and a creature without shadow can’t be blocked by creatures with shadow. (See rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”)
    // 702.28c. Multiple instances of shadow on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_28_SHADOW,

    // 702.29. Cycling
    // 702.29a. Cycling is an activated ability that functions only while the card with cycling is in a player’s hand. “Cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Draw a card.”
    // 702.29b. Although the cycling ability can be activated only if the card is in a player’s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with cycling will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.
    // 702.29c. Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they’re cycled. “When you cycle this card” means “When you discard this card to pay an activation cost of a cycling ability.” These abilities trigger from whatever zone the card winds up in after it’s cycled.
    // 702.29d. Some cards have abilities that trigger whenever a player “cycles or discards” a card. These abilities trigger only once when a card is cycled.
    // 702.29e. Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. “[Type]cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.” This type is usually a subtype (as in “mountaincycling”) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or combination thereof (as in “basic landcycling”).
    // 702.29f. Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay an activation cost of a typecycling ability. Any effect that stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards’ typecycling abilities. Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.
    RULE_702_29_CYCLING(Condition),

    // 702.30. Echo
    // 702.30a. Echo is a triggered ability. “Echo [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent came under your control since the beginning of your last upkeep, sacrifice it unless you pay [cost].”
    // 702.30b. Urza block cards with the echo ability were printed without an echo cost. These cards have been given errata in the Oracle card reference; each one now has an echo cost equal to its mana cost.

    // 702.31. Horsemanship
    // 702.31a. Horsemanship is an evasion ability.
    // 702.31b. A creature with horsemanship can’t be blocked by creatures without horsemanship. A creature with horsemanship can block a creature with or without horsemanship. (See rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”)
    // 702.31c. Multiple instances of horsemanship on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_31_HORSEMANSHIP,

    // 702.32. Fading
    // 702.32a. Fading is a keyword that represents two abilities. “Fading N” means “This permanent enters with N fade counters on it” and “At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from this permanent. If you can’t, sacrifice the permanent.”
    RULE_702_32_FADING(Condition),

    // 702.33. Kicker
    // 702.33a. Kicker is a static ability that functions while the spell with kicker is on the stack. “Kicker [cost]” means “You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell.” Paying a spell’s kicker cost(s) follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.33b. The phrase “Kicker [cost 1] and/or [cost 2]” means the same thing as “Kicker [cost 1], kicker [cost 2].”
    // 702.33c. Multikicker is a variant of the kicker ability. “Multikicker [cost]” means “You may pay an additional [cost] any number of times as you cast this spell.” A multikicker cost is a kicker cost.
    // 702.33d. If a spell’s controller declares the intention to pay any of that spell’s kicker costs, that spell has been “kicked.” If a spell has two kicker costs or has multikicker, it may be kicked multiple times. See rule 601.2b.
    // 702.33e. Objects with kicker or multikicker have additional abilities that specify what happens if they were kicked. These abilities are linked to the kicker or multikicker abilities printed on that object: they can refer only to those specific kicker or multikicker abilities. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”
    // 702.33f. Objects with more than one kicker cost may also have abilities that each correspond to a specific kicker cost. Those abilities contain the phrases “if it was kicked with its [A] kicker” and “if it was kicked with its [B] kicker,” where A and B are the first and second kicker costs listed on the card, respectively. Each of those abilities is linked to the appropriate kicker ability.
    // 702.33g. If part of a spell’s ability has its effect only if that spell was kicked, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell’s controller chooses those targets only if that spell was kicked. Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule 601.2c.
    // 702.33h. Sticker kicker is a keyword ability that represents a kicker ability and an ability that imposes an additional cost if the spell is kicked. “Sticker kicker [cost]” means “Kicker [cost]” and “As an additional cost to cast this spell, if it’s kicked, you get a ticket counter and you may put a sticker on this spell.”
    RULE_702_33_KICKER(Condition),

    // 702.34. Flashback
    // 702.34a. Flashback appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two static abilities: one that functions while the card is in a player’s graveyard and another that functions while the card is on the stack. “Flashback [cost]” means “You may cast this card from your graveyard if the resulting spell is an instant or sorcery spell by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost” and “If the flashback cost was paid, exile this card instead of putting it anywhere else any time it would leave the stack.” Casting a spell using its flashback ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_34_FLASHBACK(Condition),

    // 702.35. Madness
    // 702.35a. Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player’s hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. “Madness [cost]” means “If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but exiles it instead of putting it into their graveyard” and “When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn’t, they put this card into their graveyard.”
    // 702.35b. Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.35c. After resolving a madness triggered ability, if the exiled card wasn’t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that card. See rule 400.7k.
    RULE_702_35_MADNESS(Condition),

    // 702.36. Fear
    // 702.36a. Fear is an evasion ability.

    // 702.36c. Multiple instances of fear on the same creature are redundant.
    RULE_702_36_FEAR,

    // 702.37. Morph
    // 702.37a. Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. “Morph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost.” (See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”)
    // 702.37b. Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. “Megamorph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost” and “As this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.” A megamorph cost is a morph cost.
    // 702.37c. To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down and announce that you’re using a morph ability. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card’s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 707, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally cast it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.
    // 702.37d. You can’t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.
    // 702.37e. Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116). To do this, show all players what the permanent’s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn’t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can’t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.
    // 702.37f. If a permanent’s morph cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the morph special action was taken.
    // 702.37g. See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” for more information about how to cast cards with a morph ability.

This permanent enters with N +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You can’t reveal this card or any other cards that are entering the battlefield at the same time as this card.”

    // 702.42. Entwine
    // 702.42a. Entwine is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell is on the stack. “Entwine [cost]” means “You may choose all modes of this spell instead of just the number specified. If you do, you pay an additional [cost].” Using the entwine ability follows the rules for choosing modes and paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.

Otherwise, it enters with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.”

If you do, that spell gains the text of this card’s rules text and you pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.” Paying a card’s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.47b. You can’t choose to use a splice ability if you can’t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card’s rules text. You can’t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you’re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their effects will happen. The effects of the main spell must happen first.
    // 702.47c. The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the rules text of each of the spliced cards. This is a text-changing effect (see rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects”). The spell doesn’t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text gained by the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.
    // 702.47d. Choose targets for the added text normally (see rule 601.2c). Note that a spell with one or more targets won’t resolve if all of its targets are illegal on resolution.
    // 702.47e. The spell loses any splice changes once it leaves the stack for any reason.
    RULE_702_47_SPLICE(Condition),

    // 702.48. Offering
    // 702.48a. Offering is a static ability that functions while the spell with offering is on the stack. “[Quality] offering” means “As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice a [quality] permanent. If you chose to pay the additional cost, this spell’s total cost is reduced by the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost, and you may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.”
    // 702.48b. You choose which permanent to sacrifice as you make choices for the spell (see rule 601.2b), and you sacrifice that permanent as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).
    // 702.48c. Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost reduces generic mana in the spell’s total cost. Colored and colorless mana in the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost reduces mana of the same type in spell’s total cost, and any excess reduces that much generic mana in spell’s total cost. (See rule 118.7.)
    RULE_702_48_OFFERING(Condition),

    // 702.49. Ninjutsu
    // 702.49a.

    // 702.49b. The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is announced until the ability leaves the stack.
    // 702.49c. The creature put onto the battlefield with the ninjutsu ability enters attacking the same player, planeswalker, or battle as the creature that was returned to its owner’s hand.
    // 702.49d. Commander ninjutsu is a variant of the ninjutsu ability that also functions while the card with commander ninjutsu is in the command zone. “Commander ninjutsu [cost]” means “[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand or from the command zone, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner’s hand: Put this card onto the battlefield tapped and attacking.”
    RULE_702_49_NINJUTSU,

If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for the copy.” See rule 707.10.
    // 702.50b. A player can’t cast spells once a spell with epic they control resolves, but effects (such as the epic ability itself) can still put copies of spells onto the stack.

    // 702.51. Convoke
    // 702.51a. Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. “Convoke” means “For each colored mana in this spell’s total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spell’s total cost, you may tap an untapped creature you control rather than pay that mana.”
    // 702.51b. The convoke ability isn’t an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with convoke is determined.
    // 702.51c. A creature tapped to pay for mana in a spell’s total cost this way is said to have “convoked” that spell.
    // 702.51d. Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.
    RULE_702_51_CONVOKE,

    // 702.52. Dredge

Then shuffle your library. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    // 702.53b. Although the transmute ability can be activated only if the card is in a player’s hand, it continues to exist while the object is on the battlefield and in all other zones. Therefore objects with transmute will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.

    // 702.55. Haunt
    // 702.55a. Haunt is a triggered ability. “Haunt” on a permanent means “When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, exile it haunting target creature.” “Haunt” on an instant or sorcery spell means “When this spell is put into a graveyard during its resolution, exile it haunting target creature.”
    // 702.55b. Cards that are in the exile zone as the result of a haunt ability “haunt” the creature targeted by that ability. The phrase “creature it haunts” refers to the object targeted by the haunt ability, regardless of whether or not that object is still a creature.
    // 702.55c. Triggered abilities of cards with haunt that refer to the haunted creature can trigger in the exile zone.
    RULE_702_55_HAUNT(Condition),

The second is a triggered ability that functions while the spell with replicate is on the stack. “Replicate [cost]” means “As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may pay [cost] any number of times” and “When you cast this spell, if a replicate cost was paid for it, copy it for each time its replicate cost was paid. If the spell has any targets, you may choose new targets for any of the copies.” Paying a spell’s replicate cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.56b. If a spell has multiple instances of replicate, each is paid separately and triggers based on the payments made for it, not any other instance of replicate.
    RULE_702_56_REPLICATE(Condition),

    // 702.57. Forecast
    // 702.57a. A forecast ability is a special kind of activated ability that can be activated only from a player’s hand. It’s written “Forecast — [Activated ability].”
    // 702.57b. A forecast ability may be activated only during the upkeep step of the card’s owner and only once each turn. The controller of the forecast ability reveals the card with that ability from their hand as the ability is activated. That player plays with that card revealed in their hand until it leaves the player’s hand or until a step or phase that isn’t an upkeep step begins, whichever comes first.
    RULE_702_57_FORECAST,

    // 702.62a. Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a player’s hand. The second and third are triggered abilities that function in the exile zone. “Suspend N—[cost]” means “If you could begin to cast this card by putting it onto the stack from your hand, you may pay [cost] and exile it with N time counters on it. This action doesn’t use the stack,” and “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a time counter from it,” and “When the last time counter is removed from this card, if it’s exiled, you may play it without paying its mana cost if able. If you don’t, it remains exiled. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of the spell or the permanent it becomes.”
    // 702.62b. A card is “suspended” if it’s in the exile zone, has suspend, and has a time counter on it.
    // 702.62c. While determining if you could begin to cast a card with suspend, take into consideration any effects that would prohibit that card from being cast.

    // 702.90b. Damage dealt to a player by a source with infect doesn’t cause that player to lose life. Rather, it causes that source’s controller to give the player that many poison counters. See rule 120.3.
    // 702.90c. Damage dealt to a creature by a source with infect isn’t marked on that creature. Rather, it causes that source’s controller to put that many -1/-1 counters on that creature. See rule 120.3.
    // 702.90d. If an object changes zones before an effect causes it to deal damage, its last known information is used to determine whether it had infect.
    // 702.90e. The infect rules function no matter what zone an object with infect deals damage from.

    // 702.94. Miracle
    // 702.94a. Miracle is a static ability linked to a triggered ability. (See rule 603.11.) “Miracle [cost]” means “You may reveal this card from your hand as you draw it if it’s the first card you’ve drawn this turn. When you reveal this card this way, you may cast it by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost.”
    // 702.94b. If a player chooses to reveal a card using its miracle ability, they play with that card revealed until that card leaves their hand, that ability resolves, or that ability otherwise leaves the stack. (See rule 701.20a.)
    RULE_702_94_MIRACLE(Condition),

    // 702.95. Soulbond
    // 702.95a. Soulbond is a keyword that represents two triggered abilities. “Soulbond” means “When this creature enters, if you control both this creature and another creature and both are unpaired, you may pair this creature with another unpaired creature you control for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control” and “Whenever another creature you control enters, if you control both that creature and this one and both are unpaired, you may pair that creature with this creature for as long as both remain creatures on the battlefield under your control.”
    // 702.95b. A creature becomes “paired” with another as the result of a soulbond ability. Abilities may refer to a paired creature, the creature another creature is paired with, or whether a creature is paired. An “unpaired” creature is one that is not paired.
    // 702.95c. When the soulbond ability resolves, if either object that would be paired is no longer a creature, no longer on the battlefield, or no longer under the control of the player who controls the soulbond ability, neither object becomes paired.
    // 702.95d. A creature can be paired with only one other creature.

    // 702.96. Overload
    // 702.96a. Overload is a keyword that represents two static abilities that function while the spell with overload is on the stack. Overload [cost] means “You may choose to pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost” and “If you chose to pay this spell’s overload cost, change its text by replacing all instances of the word ‘target’ with the word ‘each.’” Casting a spell using its overload ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.96b. If a player chooses to pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell won’t require any targets. It may affect objects that couldn’t be chosen as legal targets if the spell were cast without its overload cost being paid.
    // 702.96c. Overload’s second ability creates a text-changing effect. See rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects.”

    // 702.97. Scavenge
    // 702.97a. Scavenge is an activated ability that functions only while the card with scavenge is in a graveyard. “Scavenge [cost]” means “[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to the power of the card you exiled on target creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    RULE_702_97_SCAVENGE,

    // 702.98. Unleash
    // 702.98a. Unleash is a keyword that represents two static abilities. “Unleash” means “You may have this permanent enter with an additional +1/+1 counter on it” and “This permanent can’t block as long as it has a +1/+1 counter on it.”
    RULE_702_98_UNLEASH,

    // 702.99. Cipher
    // 702.99a. Cipher appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities. The first is a spell ability that functions while the spell with cipher is on the stack. The second is a static ability that functions while the card with cipher is in the exile zone. “Cipher” means “If this spell is represented by a card, you may exile this card encoded on a creature you control” and “For as long as this card is encoded on that creature, that creature has ‘Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may copy the encoded card and you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.’”
    // 702.99b. The term “encoded” describes the relationship between the card with cipher while in the exile zone and the creature chosen when the spell represented by that card resolves.
    // 702.99c. The card with cipher remains encoded on the chosen creature as long as the card with cipher remains exiled and the creature remains on the battlefield. The card remains encoded on that object even if it changes controller or stops being a creature, as long as it remains on the battlefield.
    RULE_702_99_CIPHER(Condition),

    // 702.100. Evolve
    // 702.100a. Evolve is a triggered ability. “Evolve” means “Whenever a creature you control enters, if that creature’s power is greater than this creature’s power and/or that creature’s toughness is greater than this creature’s toughness, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.”
    // 702.100b. A creature “evolves” when one or more +1/+1 counters are put on it as a result of its evolve ability resolving.
    // 702.100c. A creature can’t have a greater power or toughness than a noncreature permanent.
    // 702.100d. If a creature has multiple instances of evolve, each triggers separately.

    // 702.101a. Extort is a triggered ability. “Extort” means “Whenever you cast a spell, you may pay {W/B}. If you do, each opponent loses 1 life and you gain life equal to the total life lost this way.”
    // 702.101b. If a permanent has multiple instances of extort, each triggers separately.
    RULE_702_101_EXTORT(Condition),

    // 702.102. Fuse
    // 702.102a. Fuse is a static ability found on some split cards (see rule 709, “Split Cards”) that applies while the card with fuse is in a player’s hand. If a player casts a split card with fuse from their hand, the player may choose to cast both halves of that split card rather than choose one half. This choice is made before putting the split card with fuse onto the stack. The resulting spell is a fused split spell.
    // 702.102b. A fused split spell has the combined characteristics of its two halves. (See rule 709.4.)
    // 702.102c. The total cost of a fused split spell includes the mana cost of each half.
    // 702.102d. As a fused split spell resolves, the controller of the spell follows the instructions of the left half and then follows the instructions of the right half.
    RULE_702_102_FUSE(Condition),

    // 702.103. Bestow
    // 702.103a. Bestow represents a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on. “Bestow [cost]” means “As you cast this spell, you may choose to cast it bestowed. If you do, you pay [cost] rather than its mana cost.” Casting a spell using its bestow ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2f–h).
    // 702.103b. As a spell cast bestowed is put onto the stack, it becomes an Aura enchantment and gains enchant creature. It is a bestowed Aura spell, and the permanent it becomes as it resolves will be a bestowed Aura. These effects last until the spell or the permanent it becomes ceases to be bestowed (see rules 702.103e–g). Because the spell is an Aura spell, its controller must choose a legal target for that spell as defined by its enchant creature ability and rule 601.2c. See also rule 303.4.
    // 702.103c. If a bestowed Aura spell is copied, the copy is also a bestowed Aura spell. Any rule that refers to a spell cast bestowed applies to the copy as well.
    // 702.103d. When casting a spell bestowed, only its characteristics as modified by the bestow ability are evaluated to determine if it can be cast.
    // 702.103e. As a bestowed Aura spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be bestowed and the effect making it an Aura spell ends. It continues resolving as a creature spell. See rule 608.3b.
    // 702.103f. If a bestowed Aura becomes unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. If a bestowed Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, it becomes unattached and ceases to be bestowed. This is an exception to rule 704.5m.
    // 702.103g. If a bestowed Aura phases in unattached, it ceases to be bestowed. See rule 702.26, “Phasing.”
    RULE_702_103_BESTOW(Condition),

    // 702.104. Tribute
    // 702.104a. Tribute is a static ability that functions as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. “Tribute N” means “As this creature enters, choose an opponent. That player may put an additional N +1/+1 counters on it as it enters.”
    // 702.104b. Objects with tribute have triggered abilities that check “if tribute wasn’t paid.” This condition is true if the opponent chosen as a result of the tribute ability didn’t have the creature enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters as specified by the creature’s tribute ability.
    RULE_702_104_TRIBUTE(Condition),

    // 702.105. Dethrone
    // 702.105a. Dethrone is a triggered ability. “Dethrone” means “Whenever this creature attacks the player with the most life or tied for most life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.”
    // 702.105b. If a creature has multiple instances of dethrone, each triggers separately.
    RULE_702_105_DETHRONE(Condition),

    // 702.106. Hidden Agenda
    // 702.106a. Hidden agenda is a static ability that functions as a conspiracy card with hidden agenda is put into the command zone. “Hidden agenda” means “As you put this conspiracy card into the command zone, turn it face down and secretly choose a card name.”
    // 702.106b. To secretly choose a card name, note that name on a piece of paper kept with the face-down conspiracy card.
    // 702.106c. Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down conspiracy card you control in the command zone face up. This is a special action. Doing so will reveal the chosen name. See rule 116.2j.
    // 702.106d. Hidden agenda and another ability of the object with hidden agenda that refers to “the chosen name” are linked. The second ability refers only to the card name chosen as a result of that object’s hidden agenda ability. See rule 607.2d.
    // 702.106e. If a player leaves the game, all face-down conspiracy cards controlled by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down conspiracy cards must be revealed to all players.
    // 702.106f. Double agenda is a variant of the hidden agenda ability. As you put a conspiracy card with double agenda into the command zone, you secretly name two different cards rather than one. You don’t reveal that more than one name was secretly chosen until you reveal the chosen names.
    RULE_702_106_HIDDEN_AGENDA(Condition),

    // 702.107. Outlast
    // 702.107a. Outlast is an activated ability. “Outlast [cost]” means “[Cost], {T}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    RULE_702_107_OUTLAST,

    // 702.108. Prowess
    // 702.108a. Prowess is a triggered ability. “Prowess” means “Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.”
    // 702.108b. If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.
    RULE_702_108_PROWESS(Condition),

    // 702.109. Dash
    // 702.109a. Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the object with dash is on the battlefield. “Dash [cost]” means “You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost,” “If this spell’s dash cost was paid, return the permanent this spell becomes to its owner’s hand at the beginning of the next end step,” and “As long as this permanent’s dash cost was paid, it has haste.” Casting a spell for its dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_109_DASH(Condition),

    // 702.110. Exploit
    // 702.110a. Exploit is a triggered ability. “Exploit” means “When this creature enters, you may sacrifice a creature.”
    // 702.110b. A creature with exploit “exploits a creature” when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices a creature as that ability resolves.
    RULE_702_110_EXPLOIT(Condition),

    // 702.111. Menace
    // 702.111a. Menace is an evasion ability.

    RULE_702_111_MENACE,

    // 702.112. Renown
    // 702.112a. Renown is a triggered ability. “Renown N” means “When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn’t renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.”
    // 702.112b. Renowned is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the renown ability and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become renowned. Once a permanent becomes renowned, it stays renowned until it leaves the battlefield. Renowned is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 702.112c. If a creature has multiple instances of renown, each triggers separately. The first such ability to resolve will cause the creature to become renowned, and subsequent abilities will have no effect. (See rule 603.4)
    RULE_702_112_RENOWN(Condition),

    // 702.113. Awaken
    // 702.113a. Awaken appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents two abilities: a static ability that functions while the spell with awaken is on the stack and a spell ability. “Awaken N—[cost]” means “You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost as you cast this spell” and “If this spell’s awaken cost was paid, put N +1/+1 counters on target land you control. That land becomes a 0/0 Elemental creature with haste. It’s still a land.” Casting a spell using its awaken ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.113b. The controller of a spell with awaken chooses the target of the awaken spell ability only if that player chose to pay the spell’s awaken cost. Otherwise the spell is cast as if it didn’t have that target.
    RULE_702_113_AWAKEN(Condition),

    RULE_702_118_SKULK,

    // 702.119. Emerge
    // 702.119a. Emerge represents two static abilities that function while the spell with emerge is on the stack. “Emerge [cost]” means “You may cast this spell by paying [cost] and sacrificing a creature rather than paying its mana cost” and “If you chose to pay this spell’s emerge cost, its total cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to the sacrificed creature’s mana value.” Casting a spell using its emerge ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.119b. Emerge from [quality] is a variant of emerge. “Emerge from [quality] [cost]” means “You may cast this spell by paying [cost] and sacrificing a [quality] permanent rather than paying its mana cost” and “If you pay this spell’s emerge cost, its total cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to the sacrificed permanent’s mana value.”
    // 702.119c. You choose which permanent to sacrifice as you choose to pay a spell’s emerge cost (see rule 601.2b), and you sacrifice that permanent as you pay the total cost (see rule 601.2h).

    // 702.120. Escalate
    // 702.120a. Escalate is a static ability of modal spells (see rule 700.2) that functions while the spell with escalate is on the stack. “Escalate [cost]” means “For each mode you choose beyond the first as you cast this spell, you pay an additional [cost].” Paying a spell’s escalate cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_120_ESCALATE,

    // 702.122c. If an effect states that a creature “can’t crew Vehicles,” that creature can’t be tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle.
    // 702.122d. Some Vehicles have abilities that trigger when they become crewed. “Whenever [this Vehicle] becomes crewed” means “Whenever a crew ability of [this Vehicle] resolves.” If that ability has an intervening “if” clause that refers to information about the creatures that crewed it, it means only creatures that were tapped to pay the cost of the crew ability that caused it to trigger.
    RULE_702_122_CREW(Condition),

    RULE_702_123_FABRICATE(Condition),

    // 702.124. Partner
    // 702.124a. Partner abilities are keyword abilities that modify the rules for deck construction in the Commander variant (see rule 903), and they function before the game begins. Each partner ability allows you to designate two legendary cards as your commander rather than one. Each partner ability has its own requirements for those two commanders. The partner abilities are: partner, partner—[text], partner with [name], choose a Background, and Doctor’s companion.
    // 702.124b. Your deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its two commanders. Both commanders begin the game in the command zone.
    // 702.124c. A rule or effect that refers to your commander’s color identity refers to the combined color identities of your two commanders. See rule 903.4.
    // 702.124d. Except for determining the color identity of your commander, the two commanders function independently. When casting a commander with partner, ignore how many times your other commander has been cast (see rule 903.8). When determining whether a player has been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander, consider damage from each of your two commanders separately (see rule 903.10a).
    // 702.124e. If an effect refers to your commander while you have two commanders, it refers to either one. If an effect causes you to perform an action on your commander and it could affect both, you choose which it refers to at the time the effect is applied.
    // 702.124f. Different partner abilities are distinct from one another and cannot be combined. For example, you cannot designate two cards as your commander if one of them has “partner” and the other has “partner with [name].”
    // 702.124g. If a legendary card has more than one partner ability, you may choose which one to use when designating your commander, but you can’t use both. Notably, no partner ability or combination of partner abilities can ever let a player have more than two commanders.
    // 702.124h. “Partner” means “You may designate two legendary cards as your commander rather than one if each of them has partner.”
    // 702.124i. “Partner—[text]” means “You may designate two legendary cards as your commander rather than one if each of them has the same ‘partner—[text]’ ability.” The “partner—[text]” abilities are “partner—Character select,” “partner—Father & son,” “partner—Friends forever,” and “partner—Survivors.”
    // 702.124j. “Partner with [name]” represents two abilities. It means “You may designate two legendary cards as your commander rather than one if each has a ‘partner with [name]’ ability with the other’s name” and “When this permanent enters, target player may search their library for a card named [name], reveal it, put it into their hand, then shuffle.”
    // 702.124k. “Choose a Background” means “You may designate two cards as your commander rather than one if one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Background enchantment card.” You can’t designate two cards as your commander if one has a “choose a Background” ability and the other is not a legendary Background enchantment card, and legendary Background enchantment cards can’t be your commander unless you have also designated a commander with “choose a Background.”
    // 702.124m. “Doctor’s companion” means “You may designate two legendary creature cards as your commander rather than one if one of them is this card and the other is a legendary Time Lord Doctor creature card that has no other creature types.”
    // 702.124n. If an effect refers to a partner ability by name, it means only that partner ability and not any others. If an effect refers to the partner ability or cards with partner and doesn’t mention a specific variant of the partner ability by name, it is referring only to partner, partner—[text], partner with [name], or cards with any of those abilities, and it does not refer to any other partner variant.

    // 702.125. Undaunted
    // 702.125a. Undaunted is a static ability that functions while the spell with undaunted is on the stack. Undaunted means “This spell costs {1} less to cast for each opponent you have.”
    // 702.125b. Players who have left the game are not counted when determining how many opponents you have.

    RULE_702_125_UNDAUNTED(Condition),

    // 702.126. Improvise
    // 702.126a. Improvise is a static ability that functions while the spell with improvise is on the stack. “Improvise” means “For each generic mana in this spell’s total cost, you may tap an untapped artifact you control rather than pay that mana.”
    // 702.126b. The improvise ability isn’t an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with improvise is determined.

    // 702.131c. The city’s blessing is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that other rules and effects can identify. Any number of players may have the city’s blessing at the same time.
    // 702.131d. After a player gets the city’s blessing, continuous effects are reapplied before the game checks to see if the game state or preceding events have matched any trigger conditions.

(See rule 103.2b.) Once during the game, any time you have priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of your turn, you may pay {3} and put that card into your hand. This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116.2g). This is a change from previous rules.
    // 702.139b. If a companion ability refers to your starting deck, it refers to your deck after you’ve set aside any sideboard cards. In a Commander game, this is also before you’ve set aside your commander.

If you do, it becomes a mutating creature spell and targets a non-Human creature with the same owner as this spell.” Casting a spell using its mutate ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs (see 601.2b and 601.2f–h).
    // 702.140b. As a mutating creature spell begins resolving, if its target is illegal, it ceases to be a mutating creature spell and continues resolving as a creature spell and will be put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller.
    // 702.140c. As a mutating creature spell resolves, if its target is legal, it doesn’t enter the battlefield. Rather, it merges with the target creature and becomes one object represented by more than one card or token (see rule 730, “Merging with Permanents”). The spell’s controller chooses whether the spell is put on top of the creature or on the bottom. The resulting permanent is a mutated permanent.
    // 702.140d. An ability that triggers whenever a creature mutates triggers when a spell merges with a creature as a result of a resolving mutating creature spell.
    // 702.140e. A mutated permanent has all abilities of each card and token that represents it. Its other characteristics are derived from the topmost card or token.
    // 702.140f. Any effect that refers to or modifies the mutating creature spell refers to or modifies the mutated permanent it merges with as it resolves.
    RULE_702_140_MUTATE(Condition),

    // 702.143. Foretell
    // 702.143a. Foretell is a keyword that functions while the card with foretell is in a player’s hand. Any time a player has priority during their turn, that player may pay {2} and exile a card with foretell from their hand face down. That player may look at that card as long as it remains in exile. They may cast that card after the current turn has ended by paying any foretell cost it has rather than paying that spell’s mana cost. Casting a spell this way follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.143b. Exiling a card using its foretell ability is a special action, which doesn’t use the stack. See rule 116, “Special Actions.”
    // 702.143c. If an effect refers to foretelling a card, it means performing the special action associated with a foretell ability. If an effect refers to a card or spell that was foretold, it means a card put in the exile zone as a result of the special action associated with a foretell ability, or a spell that was a foretold card before it was cast, even if it was cast for a cost other than a foretell cost.
    // 702.143d. If an effect states that a card in exile becomes foretold, that card becomes a foretold card. That effect may give the card a foretell cost. That card’s owner may look at that card as long as it remains in exile and it may be cast for any foretell cost it has after the turn it became a foretold card has ended, even if the resulting spell doesn’t have foretell.
    // 702.143e. If a player owns multiple foretold cards in exile, they must ensure that those cards can be easily differentiated from each other and from any other face-down cards in exile which that player owns. This includes knowing both the order in which those cards were put into exile and any foretell costs other than their printed foretell costs those cards may have.
    // 702.143f. If a player leaves the game, all face-down foretold cards that player owns must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down foretold cards must be revealed to all players.

    // 702.145c. Any time a player controls a permanent that is front face up with daybound and it’s night, that player transforms that permanent. This happens immediately and isn’t a state-based action.
    // 702.145d. Any time a player controls a permanent with daybound, if it’s neither day nor night, it becomes day.
    // 702.145e. Nightbound is found on the back faces of some double-faced cards and represents two static abilities. “Nightbound” means “As it becomes day, if this permanent is back face up, transform it” and “This permanent can’t transform except due to its nightbound ability.”

    // 702.166. Bargain
    // 702.166a. Bargain is a static ability that functions while the spell with bargain is on the stack. “Bargain” means “As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may sacrifice an artifact, enchantment, or token.” Paying a spell’s bargain cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    // 702.166b. If a spell’s controller declares the intention to pay that spell’s bargain cost, that spell has been “bargained.” See rule 601.2b.
    // 702.166c. Objects with bargain have additional abilities that specify what happens if they were bargained. These abilities are linked to the bargain ability printed on that object: they can refer only to that specific bargain ability. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”
    // 702.166d. If part of a spell’s ability has its effect only if that spell was bargained and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell’s controller chooses those targets only if that spell was bargained. Otherwise, the spell is cast as if it did not have those targets. See rule 601.2c.
    RULE_702_166_BARGAIN(Condition),

    // 702.167. Craft
    // 702.167a. Craft represents an activated ability. It is written as “Craft with [materials] [cost],” where [materials] is a description of one or more objects. It means “[Cost], Exile this permanent, Exile [materials] from among permanents you control and/or cards in your graveyard: Return this card to the battlefield transformed under its owner’s control. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    // 702.167b. If an object in the [materials] of a craft ability is described using only a card type or subtype without the word “card,” it refers to either a permanent on the battlefield that is that type or subtype or a card in a graveyard that is that type or subtype. This is an exception to rule 109.2.
    // 702.167c. An ability of a permanent may refer to the exiled cards used to craft it. This refers to cards in exile that were exiled to pay the activation cost of the craft ability that put this permanent onto the battlefield.
    RULE_702_167_CRAFT(Condition),

    // 702.168. Disguise
    // 702.168a. Disguise is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on, and the disguise effect works any time the card is face down. “Disguise [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with ward {2}, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying {3} rather than paying its mana cost.” (See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”)
    // 702.168b. To cast a card using its disguise ability, turn the card face down and announce that you are using a disguise ability. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with ward {2}, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card’s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 707, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay {3} rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a disguise ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally cast it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The disguise effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.
    // 702.168c. You can’t normally cast a card face down. A disguise ability allows you to do so.
    // 702.168d. Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a disguise ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule 116). To do this, show all players what the permanent’s disguise cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn’t have a disguise cost if it were face up, it can’t be turned face up this way.) The disguise effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.
    // 702.168e. If a permanent’s disguise cost includes X, other abilities of that permanent may also refer to X. The value of X in those abilities is equal to the value of X chosen as the disguise special action was taken.
    // 702.168f. See rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” for more information about how to cast cards with a disguise ability.
    RULE_702_168_DISGUISE(Condition),

    // 702.169. Solved
    // 702.169a. Solved is a keyword ability found on Case cards. See rule 719, “Case Cards.” “Solved” is followed by ability text. Together, they represent a static ability, a triggered ability, or an activated ability.
    // 702.169b. For a static ability, “Solved — [Ability text]” means “As long as this Case is solved, [ability text].”
    // 702.169c. For a triggered ability, “Solved — [Ability text]” means “[Ability text]. This ability triggers only if this Case is solved.”
    // 702.169d. For an activated ability, “Solved — [Ability text]” means “[Ability text]. Activate only if this Case is solved.”
    RULE_702_169_SOLVED(Condition),

    // 702.170. Plot
    // 702.170a. Plot is a keyword ability that functions while the card with plot is in a player’s hand. “Plot [cost]” means “Any time you have priority during your main phase while the stack is empty, you may exile this card from your hand and pay [cost]. It becomes a plotted card.”
    // 702.170b. Exiling a card using its plot ability is a special action, which doesn’t use the stack. See rule 116, “Special Actions.”
    // 702.170c. In addition to the plot special action, some spells and abilities cause a card in exile to become plotted.
    // 702.170d. A plotted card’s owner may cast it from exile without paying its mana cost during their main phase while the stack is empty during any turn after the turn in which it became plotted. Casting a spell this way follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h. A plotted card may be cast this way even if it doesn’t have the plot ability while in exile.
    // 702.170e. If an effect refers to plotting a card, it means performing the special action associated with a plot ability.
    // 702.170f. An effect may allow the plot ability of a card to function in a zone other than a player’s hand. In that case, the card is exiled from the zone it is in as the action is taken rather than from its owner’s hand.
    RULE_702_170_PLOT_KEYWORD_ABILITY_FUNCTIONS_CARD(Condition),

    // 702.171. Saddle
    // 702.171a. Saddle is an activated ability. “Saddle N” means “Tap any number of other untapped creatures you control with total power N or greater: This permanent becomes saddled until end of turn. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    // 702.171b. Saddled is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become saddled. Once a permanent has become saddled, it stays saddled until the end of the turn or it leaves the battlefield. Being saddled is not a part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 702.171c. A creature “saddles” a permanent as it’s tapped to pay the cost to activate a permanent’s saddle ability.
    RULE_702_171_SADDLE,

    // 702.172. Spree
    // 702.172a. Spree is a static ability found on some modal spells (see rule 700.2) that applies while the spell on the stack. Spree means “Choose one or more modes. As an additional cost to cast this spell, pay the costs associated with those modes.”
    // 702.172b. Cards with the spree ability have a plus sign icon in the upper right corner of the card, and use a plus sign (+) rather than traditional bullet points. These symbols are a visual reminder that this card requires an additional cost to be cast, and do not have additional rules meaning.
    RULE_702_172_SPREE,

    // 702.173. Freerunning
    // 702.173a. Freerunning is a static ability that functions on the stack. “Freerunning [cost]” means “You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost if a player was dealt combat damage this turn by a creature that, at the time it dealt that damage, was an Assassin creature or a commander under your control.” Casting a spell for its freerunning cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_173_FREERUNNING(Condition),

    // 702.174. Gift
    // 702.174a. Gift is a keyword that represents two abilities. It is written “Gift a [something].” The first ability is a static ability that functions while the card with gift is on the stack, and the second is either an ability that functions while the card with gift is on the stack or a triggered ability that functions while the card with gift is on the battlefield. The first ability is always “As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may choose an opponent.” Paying a spell’s gift cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h. The second ability depends on the [something] listed as well as whether the object with the ability is a permanent or an instant or sorcery spell.
    // 702.174b. On a permanent, the second ability represented by gift is “When this permanent enters, if its gift cost was paid, [effect].” On an instant or sorcery spell, the second ability represented by gift is “If this spell’s gift cost was paid, [effect].” The specific effect is defined by the [something] listed.
    // 702.174c. Some effects trigger whenever a player gives a gift. Such an ability triggers whenever an instant or sorcery spell that player controls whose gift cost was paid resolves. It also triggers whenever the gift triggered ability of a permanent that player controls resolves.
    // 702.174d. “Gift a Food” means the effect is “The chosen player creates a Food token.”
    // 702.174e. “Gift a card” means the effect is “The chosen player draws a card.”
    // 702.174f. “Gift a tapped Fish” means the effect is “The chosen player creates a tapped 1/1 blue Fish creature token.”
    // 702.174g. “Gift an extra turn” means the effect is “The chosen player takes an extra turn after this one.”
    // 702.174h. “Gift a Treasure” means the effect is “The chosen player creates a Treasure token.”
    // 702.174i. “Gift an Octopus” means the effect is “The chosen player creates an 8/8 blue Octopus creature token.”
    // 702.174j. For instant and sorcery spells, the effect of a gift ability always happens before any other spell abilities of the card. If the spell is countered or otherwise leaves the stack before resolving, the gift effect doesn’t happen.
    // 702.174k. If a spell’s controller declares the intention to pay a spell’s gift cost, that spell’s gift was promised.
    // 702.174m. If part of a spell’s ability has its effect only if its gift was promised, and that part of the ability includes any targets, the spell’s controller chooses those targets only if the gift was promised.
    RULE_702_174_GIFT(Condition),

    // 702.175. Offspring
    // 702.175a. Offspring represents two abilities. “Offspring [cost]” means “You may pay an additional [cost] as you cast this spell” and “When this permanent enters, if its offspring cost was paid, create a token that’s a copy of it, except it’s 1/1.”
    // 702.175b. If a spell has multiple instances of offspring, each is paid separately and triggers based on the payments made for it, not any other instances of offspring.
    RULE_702_175_OFFSPRING(Condition),

    // 702.176. Impending
    // 702.176a. Impending is a keyword that represents four abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the spell with impending is on the stack. The second is static ability that creates a replacement effect that may apply to the permanent with impending as it enters the battlefield from the stack. The third is a static ability that functions on the battlefield. The fourth is a triggered ability that functions on the battlefield. “Impending N—[cost]” means “You may choose to pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost,” “If you chose to pay this permanent’s impending cost, it enters with N time counters on it,” “As long as this permanent’s impending cost was paid and it has a time counter on it, it’s not a creature,” and “At the beginning of your end step, if this permanent’s impending cost was paid and it has a time counter on it, remove a time counter from it.” Casting a spell for its impending cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.
    RULE_702_176_IMPENDING(Condition),

    // 702.177. Exhaust
    // 702.177a. An exhaust ability is a special kind of activated ability. “Exhaust — [Cost]: [Effect]” means “[Cost]: [Effect]. Activate only once.”
    // 702.177b. An effect may allow you to take an action as long as you haven’t activated an exhaust ability this turn. Such an effect allows that action only if you haven’t begun to activate an exhaust ability this turn.
    RULE_702_177_EXHAUST(Condition),

    // 702.178. Max Speed
    // 702.178a. A max speed ability is a special kind of static ability. “Max speed — [Ability]” means “As long as your speed is 4, this object has ‘[Ability].’” See rule 702.179, “Start Your Engines!”
    // 702.178b. If an ability granted by a max speed ability states which zones it functions from, the max speed ability that grants that ability functions from those zones. (See rule 113.6c.)
    RULE_702_178_MAX_SPEED(Condition),

    // 702.179. Start Your Engines!
    // 702.179a. Start your engines! is a static ability. If a player controls a permanent with start your engines! and that player has no speed, their speed becomes 1. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.
    // 702.179b. Players do not have speed until a rule or effect sets their speed to a specific value.
    // 702.179c. If a player has no speed and they are instructed to increase their speed by a certain value, their speed becomes that value.
    // 702.179d. There is an inherent triggered ability associated with a player having 1 or more speed. This ability has no source and is controlled by that player. That ability is “Whenever one or more opponents lose life during your turn, if your speed is less than 4, your speed increases by 1. This ability triggers only once each turn.”
    // 702.179e. Rules and effects may refer to whether a player has “max speed.” A player has max speed if their speed is 4.
    // 702.179f. Some effects refer to a player’s speed. If that player has no speed, their speed is 0 for the purpose of an effect that refers to speed.

Whenever a player would get priority (see rule 117, “Timing and Priority”), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see rule 514), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the step’s first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets priority and the step ends.
    RULE_704_3_PLAYER_PRIORITY_GAME_CHECKS_LISTED(Condition),

    // 704.4. Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.
    RULE_704_4_UNLIKE_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_STATE_BASED,

    // 704.5. The state-based actions are as follows:
    // 704.5a. If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game.
    // 704.5b. If a player attempted to draw a card from a library with no cards in it since the last time state-based actions were checked, that player loses the game.
    // 704.5c. If a player has ten or more poison counters, that player loses the game. Ignore this rule in Two-Headed Giant games; see rule 704.6b instead.
    // 704.5d. If a token is in a zone other than the battlefield, it ceases to exist.
    // 704.5e. If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist.
    // 704.5f. If a creature has toughness 0 or less, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard. Regeneration can’t replace this event.
    // 704.5g. If a creature has toughness greater than 0, it has damage marked on it, and the total damage marked on it is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.
    // 704.5h. If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it’s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.
    // 704.5i. If a planeswalker has loyalty 0, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 704.5j. If two or more legendary permanents with the same name are controlled by the same player, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners’ graveyards. This is called the “legend rule.”
    // 704.5k. If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has had the world supertype for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners’ graveyards. In the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This is called the “world rule.”
    // 704.5m. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, or is not attached to an object or player, that Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 704.5n. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent or to a player, it becomes unattached from that permanent or player. It remains on the battlefield.
    // 704.5p. If a battle or creature is attached to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield. Similarly, if any nonbattle, noncreature permanent that’s neither an Aura, an Equipment, nor a Fortification is attached to an object or player, it becomes unattached and remains on the battlefield.
    // 704.5q. If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.
    // 704.5r. If a permanent with an ability that says it can’t have more than N counters of a certain kind on it has more than N counters of that kind on it, all but N of those counters are removed from it.
    // 704.5s. If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent with one or more chapter abilities is greater than or equal to its final chapter number and it isn’t the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Saga’s controller sacrifices it. See rule 714, “Saga Cards.”
    // 704.5t. If a player’s venture marker is on the bottommost room of a dungeon card, and that dungeon card isn’t the source of a room ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the dungeon card’s owner removes it from the game. See rule 309, “Dungeons.”
    // 704.5u. If a permanent with space sculptor and any creatures without a sector designation are on the battlefield, each player who controls one or more of those creatures and doesn’t control a permanent with space sculptor chooses a sector designation for each of those creatures they control. Then, each other player who controls one or more of those creatures chooses a sector designation for each of those creatures they control. See rule 702.158, “Space Sculptor.”
    // 704.5v. If a battle has defense 0 and it isn’t the source of an ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, it’s put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 704.5w. If a battle has no player in the game designated as its protector and no attacking creatures are currently attacking that battle, that battle’s controller chooses an appropriate player to be its protector based on its battle type. If no player can be chosen this way, the battle is put into its owner’s graveyard. See rule 310, “Battles.”
    // 704.5x. If a Siege’s controller is also its designated protector, that player chooses an opponent to become its protector. If no player can be chosen this way, the battle is put into its owner’s graveyard. See rule 310, “Battles.”
    // 704.5y. If a permanent has more than one Role controlled by the same player attached to it, each of those Roles except the one with the most recent timestamp is put into its owner’s graveyard.
    // 704.5z. If a player controls a permanent with start your engines! and that player has no speed, that player’s speed becomes 1. See rule 702.179, “Start Your Engines!”
    RULE_704_5_STATE_BASED_ACTIONS(Condition),

    // 704.6. Some variant games include additional state-based actions that aren’t normally applicable:
    // 704.6a. In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has 0 or less life, that team loses the game. See rule 810, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”
    // 704.6b. In a Two-Headed Giant game, if a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. See rule 810, “Two-Headed Giant Variant.”
    // 704.6c. In a Commander game, a player who’s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. See rule 903, “Commander.”
    // 704.6d. In a Commander game, if a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. See rule 903, “Commander.”
    // 704.6e. In an Archenemy game, if a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck. See rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    // 704.6f. In a Planechase game, if a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isn’t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_704_6_VARIANT_GAMES_INCLUDE_ADDITIONAL_STATE(Condition),

    // 704.7. If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the same time, a single replacement effect will replace all of them.
    RULE_704_7_MULTIPLE_STATE_BASED_ACTIONS_RESULT(Condition),

    // 704.8. If a state-based action results in a permanent leaving the battlefield at the same time other state-based actions were performed, that permanent’s last known information is derived from the game state before any of those state-based actions were performed.
    RULE_704_8_STATE_BASED_ACTION_RESULTS_PERMANENT(Condition),

    // 705.1. Some cards refer to flipping a coin. A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up. If the coin that’s being flipped doesn’t have an obvious “heads” or “tails,” designate one side to be “heads,” and the other side to be “tails.” Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call “odds” or “evens,” or roll an even-sided die and designate that “odds” means “heads” and “evens” means “tails.”
    RULE_705_1_CARDS_FLIPPING_COIN_FLIP_SIDED(Condition),

    // 705.2. Some effects that instruct a player to flip a coin care only about whether the coin comes up heads or tails. No player wins or loses a coin flip for this kind of effect. For all other effects that instruct a player to flip a coin, the player that flips the coin calls “heads” or “tails.” If the call matches the result, the player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.
    RULE_705_2_EFFECTS_PLAYER_FLIP_COIN_CARE(Condition),

    // 705.3. An effect may state that a coin flip has a certain result and/or that a certain player wins a coin flip. In that case, ignore the actual results of that flip and use the indicated results instead. This can cause a player to win a flip that couldn’t otherwise be won.
    RULE_705_3_EFFECT_STATE_COIN_FLIP_RESULT(Condition),

    // 706.1. An effect that instructs a player to roll a die will specify what kind of die to roll and how many of those dice to roll.
    // 706.1a. Such an effect may refer to an “N-sided die,” “N-sided dice,” or one or more “dN,” where N is a positive integer. In those cases, the die must have N equally likely outcomes, numbered from 1 to N. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.
    // 706.1b. Players may agree to use an alternate method for rolling a die, including a digital substitute, as long as the method used has the same number of equally likely outcomes as the die specified in the instruction.
    RULE_706_1_EFFECT_PLAYER_ROLL_DIE_SPECIFY,

    // 706.2. After the roll, the number indicated on the top face of the die before any modifiers is the natural result. The instruction may include modifiers to the roll which add to or subtract from the natural result. Modifiers may also come from other sources. After considering all applicable modifiers, the final number is the result of the die roll.
    // 706.2a. Modifiers may be optional and/or have associated costs. If a modifier has an associated mana cost, the player who rolled has the chance to activate mana abilities before applying it.
    // 706.2b. If two or more effects are attempting to modify the natural result, the player who rolled chooses one to apply, following these steps: First, consider any effects that modify the result of a die roll by rerolling that die. Second, consider any effects that modify the result of a die roll by increasing or decreasing that result by a specified amount.
    RULE_706_2_ROLL_NUMBER_INDICATED_TOP_FACE(Condition),

    // 706.3. Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice include a results table.
    // 706.3a. The results table appears as a list or as a chart with multiple striations. Each list item or striation includes possible results and an effect associated with those results. The possible results indicated could be a single number, a range of numbers with two endpoints in the form “N1–N2,” or a range with a single endpoint in the form “N+.” Each one means “If the result was in this range, [effect].” After a die roll, use the result to determine which effect listed on the results table happens, if any.
    // 706.3b. An instruction to roll one or more dice, any instructions to modify that roll printed in the same paragraph, any additional instructions based on the result of the roll, and the associated results table are all part of one ability.
    // 706.3c. Some effects in results charts include the text “Roll again.” This additional roll uses the same kind of and number of dice originally called for, including any applicable modifiers.
    RULE_706_3_ABILITIES_PLAYER_ROLL_DICE_INCLUDE(Condition),

    // 706.4. Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice do not include a results table. The text of those abilities will indicate how to use the results of the die rolls, if at all.
    RULE_706_4_ABILITIES_PLAYER_ROLL_DICE_INCLUDE(Condition),

    // 706.5. One card (Celebr-8000) has an ability that instructs a player to roll two dice and has an additional effect if that player “rolled doubles.” A player has rolled doubles if the result of each of those rolls is equal to the other.
    RULE_706_5_CARD_CELEBR_ABILITY_PLAYER_ROLL(Condition),

    // 706.6. If a player is instructed to ignore a roll, that roll is considered to have never happened. No abilities trigger because of the ignored roll, and no effects apply to that roll. If that player was instructed to ignore the lowest roll and multiple results are tied for the lowest, the player chooses one of those rolls to be ignored.
    RULE_706_6_PLAYER_IGNORE_ROLL_CONSIDERED_HAPPENED(Condition),

    // 706.7. In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that exchange the results of that roll with another value or compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_706_7_PLANECHASE_GAME_ROLLING_PLANAR_DIE(Condition),

    // 706.8. One card (Centaur of Attention) has an ability that instructs a player to roll dice and “store” those results on it and another ability that allows a player to reroll any number of those results.
    // 706.8a. To store the result of a die roll on a permanent means to note both the kind of die rolled and the result of that roll. That noted information is considered a “stored result” of that permanent, and the result is the “value” of that stored result.
    // 706.8b. To reroll one or more stored results of a permanent, roll one of the kind of die noted for each of them. If one kind of die is noted for more than one of those results, roll that many of that kind of die. The results you rerolled stop being stored results, and you store the results of each of the new die rolls on that permanent.
    // 706.8c. If a permanent has an ability that stores results on it and another ability that refers to the stored results, those abilities are linked. (See rule 607.2e.)
    RULE_706_8_CARD_CENTAUR_ATTENTION_ABILITY_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 707.1. Some objects become or turn another object into a “copy” of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects create a token that’s a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase “search for a copy.” This section doesn’t cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)
    RULE_707_1_OBJECTS_BECOME_TURN_COPY_SPELL,

    // 707.2. When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object’s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The copiable values are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by “as . . . enters” and “as . . . is turned face up” abilities that set power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, counters, and stickers are not copied.
    // 707.2a. A copy acquires the color of the object it’s copying because that value is derived from its mana cost or color indicator. A copy acquires the abilities of the object it’s copying because those values are derived from its rules text. A copy doesn’t wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it doesn’t copy the object’s abilities and its rules text, then have that rules text define a new set of abilities).
    // 707.2b. Once an object has been copied, changing the copiable values of the original object won’t cause the copy to change.
    // 707.2c. If a static ability generates a continuous effect that’s a copy effect, the copiable values that effect grants are determined only at the time that effect first starts to apply.
    RULE_707_2_COPYING_OBJECT_COPY_ACQUIRES_COPIABLE(Condition),

    // 707.3. The copy’s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copy’s status (see rule 110.5). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.
    RULE_707_3_COPYS_COPIABLE_VALUES_BECOME_COPIED,

    // 707.4. Some effects cause a permanent that’s copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining on the battlefield. The change doesn’t cause enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities to trigger. This also doesn’t change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.
    RULE_707_4_EFFECTS_CAUSE_PERMANENT_THATS_COPYING,

    // 707.5. An object that enters the battlefield “as a copy” or “that’s a copy” of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield. It doesn’t enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text that’s being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as “enters with” or “as [this] enters” abilities), those abilities will take effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.
    RULE_707_5_OBJECT_ENTERS_BATTLEFIELD_COPY_THATS(Condition),

    // 707.6. When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent aren’t copied. Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the object’s controller will get to make any “as [this] enters the battlefield” choices for it.
    RULE_707_6_COPYING_PERMANENT_CHOICES_ARENT_COPIED(Condition),

    // 707.7. If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected by the other. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule 607, “Linked Abilities.”
    RULE_707_7_PAIR_LINKED_ABILITIES_COPIED_SIMILARLY(Condition),

    // 707.8. When copying a melded permanent or other double-faced permanent, use the copiable values of the face that’s currently up to determine the characteristics of the copy. See rule 712, “Double-Faced Cards.”
    // 707.8a. If an effect creates a token that is a copy of a double-faced permanent or a double-faced card not on the battlefield, the resulting token is a double-faced token that has both a front face and a back face. The characteristics of each face are determined by the copiable values of the same face of the permanent or card it is a copy of, as modified by any other copy effects that apply to that object. If the token is a copy of a double-faced permanent with its back face up, the token enters the battlefield with its back face up. This rule does not apply to tokens that are created with their own set of characteristics and enter the battlefield as a copy of a double-faced object due to a replacement effect.
    RULE_707_8_COPYING_MELDED_PERMANENT_DOUBLE_FACED(Condition),

    // 707.9. Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.
    // 707.9a. Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied.
    // 707.9b. Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final set of values for that characteristic becomes part of the copiable values of the copy.
    // 707.9c. Some copy effects specifically state that they don’t copy certain characteristics and the affected objects instead retain their original values. Copy effects may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied.
    // 707.9d. When applying a copy effect that doesn’t copy a certain characteristic, retains one or more original values for a certain characteristic, or provides a specific set of values for a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining ability (see rule 604.3) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule 204) of that object is also not copied. This rule does not apply to copy effects with exceptions that state the object is a certain card type, supertype, and/or subtype “in addition to its other types.” In those cases, any characteristic-defining ability that defines card type, supertype, and/or subtype is copied.
    // 707.9e. Some replacement effects that generate copy effects include an exception that’s an additional effect rather than a modification of the affected object’s characteristics. If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with that exception, the exception’s effect doesn’t happen.
    // 707.9f. Some exceptions to the copying process apply only if the copy is or has certain characteristics. To determine whether such an exception applies, consider what the resulting permanent’s characteristics would be if the copy effect were applied without that exception, taking into account any other exceptions that effect includes.
    // 707.9g. Some replacement effects that generate copy effects are linked to triggered abilities written in the same paragraph. (See rule 603.11.) If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with the linked triggered ability, the ability doesn’t trigger.
    RULE_707_9_COPY_EFFECTS_INCLUDE_MODIFICATIONS_EXCEPTIONS(Condition),

    // 707.10. To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn’t cast and a copy of an activated ability isn’t activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule 601, “Casting Spells.”) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.
    // 707.10a. If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule 704.
    // 707.10b. A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn.
    // 707.10c. Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copy’s targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.
    // 707.10d. Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it “could target.” The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controller’s choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” a copy isn’t created for that player or object.
    // 707.10e. Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of the copy’s targets must be that player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” the copy isn’t created. In the case where a replacement effect causes the copy to target more than one object, the copy’s controller chooses one of them to be the new target. The chosen target must be a legal target for that spell or ability.
    // 707.10f. Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and becomes a token permanent. (See rule 608.3f.)
    // 707.10g. If an effect creates a copy of a double-faced permanent spell, the copy is also a double-faced permanent spell that has both a front face and a back face. The characteristics of its front and back face are determined by the copiable values of the same face of the spell it is a copy of, as modified by any other copy effects. If the spell it is a copy of has its back face up, the copy is created with its back face up. The token that’s put onto the battlefield as that spell resolves is a double-faced token.
    RULE_707_10_COPY_SPELL_ZONE_THAN_STACK(Condition),

    // 707.11. If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.
    RULE_707_11_EFFECT_PERMANENT_NAME_TRACKS_CHANGES(Condition),

    // 707.12. An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps 601.2a–h of rule 601, “Casting Spells,” and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.
    RULE_707_12_EFFECT_PLAYER_CAST_COPY_OBJECT,

    // 707.13. One card (Garth One-Eye) instructs a player to create a copy of a card defined by name rather than by indicating an object to be copied. To do so, the player uses the Oracle card reference to determine the characteristics of the copy and creates the copy outside of the game.
    RULE_707_13_CARD_GARTH_EYE_PLAYER_CREATE,

    // 707.14. One card (Magar of the Magic Strings) instructs a player to note the name of a particular card in a graveyard and create a copy of the card with the noted name. To do so, use the characteristics of that card as it last existed in the graveyard to determine the copiable values of the copy. (See rule 608.2h.)
    RULE_707_14_CARD_MAGAR_MAGIC_STRINGS_PLAYER,

    // 708.1. Some cards allow spells and permanents to be face down.
    RULE_708_1_CARDS_ALLOW_SPELLS_PERMANENTS_FACE,

    // 708.2. Face-down spells and face-down permanents have no characteristics other than those listed by the ability or rules that allowed the spell or permanent to be face down. Any listed characteristics are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 707, “Copying Objects.”)
    // 708.2a. If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability that doesn’t list any characteristics for that object, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. A permanent that enters the battlefield face down also has these characteristics unless otherwise specified by the effect that put it onto the battlefield face down or allowed it to be cast face down. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics.
    // 708.2b. A face-down permanent can’t be turned face-down. If a spell or ability attempts to turn a face-down permanent face down, nothing happens and that effect doesn’t change any of its characteristics or their copiable values.
    RULE_708_2_FACE_SPELLS_PERMANENTS_CHARACTERISTICS_THAN(Condition),

    // 708.3. Objects that are put onto the battlefield face down are turned face down before they enter the battlefield, so the permanent’s enters-the-battlefield abilities won’t trigger (if triggered) or have any effect (if static).
    RULE_708_3_OBJECTS_PUT_ONTO_BATTLEFIELD_FACE(Condition),

    // 708.4. Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spell’s characteristics. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up object’s characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a face-down permanent.
    RULE_708_4_OBJECTS_CAST_FACE_TURNED_PUT(Condition),

    // 708.5. At any time, you may look at a face-down spell you control on the stack or a face-down permanent you control (even if it’s phased out). You can’t look at face-down cards in any other zone or face-down spells or permanents controlled by another player.
    RULE_708_5_TIME_LOOK_FACE_SPELL_CONTROL(Condition),

    // 708.6. If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast, the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.
    RULE_708_6_CONTROL_MULTIPLE_FACE_SPELLS_PERMANENTS(Condition),

    // 708.7. The ability or rules that allow a permanent to be face down may also allow the permanent’s controller to turn it face up. Spells normally can’t be turned face up.
    RULE_708_7_ABILITY_ALLOW_PERMANENT_FACE_CONTROLLER,

    // 708.8. As a face-down permanent is turned face up, its copiable values revert to its normal copiable values. Any effects that have been applied to the face-down permanent still apply to the face-up permanent. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.
    RULE_708_8_FACE_PERMANENT_TURNED_COPIABLE_VALUES,

    // 708.9. If a face-down permanent or a face-down component of a merged permanent moves from the battlefield to any other zone, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a face-down spell moves from the stack to any zone other than the battlefield, its owner must reveal it to all players as they move it. If a player leaves the game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells owned by that player must be revealed to all players. At the end of each game, all face-down permanents, face-down components of merged permanents, and face-down spells must be revealed to all players.
    RULE_708_9_FACE_PERMANENT_COMPONENT_MERGED_MOVES(Condition),

    // 708.10. If a face-down permanent becomes a copy of another permanent, its copiable values become the copiable values of that permanent, as modified by its face-down status. Its characteristics therefore remain the same: the characteristics listed by the ability or rules that allowed it to be turned face down. However, if it is turned face up, its copiable values become the values it copied from the other permanent. See rule 707.3.
    RULE_708_10_FACE_PERMANENT_BECOMES_COPY_COPIABLE(Condition),

    // 708.11. If a face-down permanent would have an “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . .” ability after it’s turned face up, that ability is applied while that permanent is being turned face up, not afterward.
    RULE_708_11_FACE_PERMANENT_TURNED_ABILITY_APPLIED(Condition),

    // 708.12. If a spell or ability that instructs a player to reveal a face-down permanent needs information about the revealed object, it uses the characteristics of that object ignoring any continuous effects that may be applying to it.
    RULE_708_12_SPELL_ABILITY_PLAYER_REVEAL_FACE(Condition),

    // 709.1. Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.
    RULE_709_1_SPLIT_CARDS_FACES_SINGLE_NORMAL,

    // 709.2. Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
    RULE_709_2_SPLIT_CARDS_CASTABLE_HALVES_PLAYER,

    // 709.3. A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.
    // 709.3a. Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put onto the stack.
    // 709.3b. While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other half’s characteristics are treated as though they didn’t exist.
    // 709.3c. An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule 707.12.)
    RULE_709_3_PLAYER_CHOOSES_HALF_SPLIT_CARD(Condition),

    // 709.4. In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined.
    // 709.4a. Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a split card’s name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.
    // 709.4b. The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split card’s colors and mana value are determined from its combined mana cost. An effect that refers specifically to the symbols in a split card’s mana cost sees the separate symbols rather than the whole mana cost.
    // 709.4c. A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of each half.
    // 709.4d. The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see rule 702.102, “Fuse”).
    RULE_709_4_ZONE_EXCEPT_STACK_CHARACTERISTICS_SPLIT(Condition),

    // 709.5. Some split cards are permanent cards with a single shared type line. A shared type line on such an object represents two static abilities that function on the battlefield. These are “As long as this permanent doesn’t have the ‘left half unlocked’ designation, it doesn’t have the name, mana cost, or rules text of this object’s left half” and “As long as this permanent doesn’t have the ‘right half unlocked’ designation, it doesn’t have the name, mana cost, or rules text of this object’s right half.” These abilities, as well as which half of that permanent a characteristic is in, are part of that object’s copiable values.
    // 709.5a. Each half of a split card with a shared type line shares the types and subtypes listed on that card’s shared type line.
    // 709.5b. The existence of each half of an object with a shared type line is part of that object’s copiable values, even if that object is a spell on the stack. This is an exception to rule 709.3b.
    // 709.5c. “Left half unlocked” and “right half unlocked” are designations that a permanent on the battlefield can have. Together, they are called the unlocked designations. A particular half of a permanent is said to be “unlocked” if it has the appropriate unlocked designation. Otherwise, that half is said to be “locked.”
    // 709.5d. A permanent with a shared type line is given the “left half unlocked” designation as it enters the battlefield if its left half was cast as a spell. It is given the “right half unlocked” designation as it enters the battlefield if its right half was a cast as a spell. If it’s entering the battlefield and neither half was cast as a spell, it enters with neither unlocked designation.
    // 709.5e. A player who controls a permanent that has one or more locked halves may pay the mana cost of a locked half of that permanent to give that permanent the appropriate unlocked designation. This cost is referred to as an “unlock cost.” This is a special action (see rule 116). A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn.
    // 709.5f. Some spells and abilities instruct a player to “unlock” half of a permanent. To unlock half of a permanent, a player chooses a locked half of that permanent, and that permanent is given the appropriate unlocked designation.
    // 709.5g. Some spells and abilities instruct a player to “lock” half of a permanent. To lock half of a permanent, a player chooses an unlocked half of that permanent, and that permanent loses the appropriate unlocked designation.
    // 709.5h. Some abilities trigger when a player unlocks a particular half of a permanent. These abilities trigger when that permanent is given the appropriate unlocked designation, regardless of whether it was given that designation while entering the battlefield or after entering the battlefield.
    // 709.5i. Some abilities trigger when a player “fully unlocks” a permanent with a shared type line. Such an ability triggers when that permanent has one of the two unlocked designations and gets the other, or when it has neither designation and gains both.
    // 709.5j. Some cards refer to a “door” of a Room permanent. A door is a half of that permanent.
    RULE_709_5_HALF_SPLIT_CARD_SHARED_TYPE(Condition),

    // 710.1. Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card’s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.
    // 710.1a. The top half of a flip card contains the card’s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to “flip” if certain conditions are met.
    // 710.1b. The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the permanent is flipped.
    // 710.1c. A flip card’s color and mana cost don’t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.
    RULE_710_1_FLIP_CARDS_FRAME_SINGLE_TEXT(Condition),

    // 710.2. In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness don’t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.
    RULE_710_2_ZONE_THAN_BATTLEFIELD_PERMANENT_FLIPS(Condition),

    // 710.3. You must ensure that it’s clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both when it’s untapped and when it’s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.
    RULE_710_3_ENSURE_CLEAR_TIMES_PERMANENT_CONTROL(Condition),

    // 710.4. Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it’s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status. See rule 110.5.
    RULE_710_4_FLIPPING_PERMANENT_WAY_PROCESS_ONCE(Condition),

    // 710.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
    RULE_710_5_EFFECT_PLAYER_CHOOSE_CARD_NAME(Condition),

    // 711.1. Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols.
    RULE_711_1_LEVELER_CARD_STRIATED_TEXT_BOX,

    // 711.2. A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,” or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as “[P/T].”
    // 711.2a. “{LEVEL N1-N2} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”
    // 711.2b. “{LEVEL N3+} [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”
    RULE_711_2_LEVEL_SYMBOL_KEYWORD_ABILITY_STATIC(Condition),

    // 711.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text box.
    RULE_711_3_TEXT_BOX_STRIATIONS_GAME_SIGNIFICANCE,

    // 711.4. Any ability a leveler card has that isn’t preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule 702.87) at all times; it may be activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.
    RULE_711_4_ABILITY_LEVELER_CARD_ISNT_PRECEDED(Condition),

    // 711.5. If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its {LEVEL N1-N2} symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.
    RULE_711_5_NUMBER_LEVEL_COUNTERS_LEVELER_CREATURE(Condition),

    // 711.7. Some enchantments have the subtype Class and associated abilities that give them a class level. These are not level up abilities and class levels do not interact with level counters. See rule 716, “Class Cards.”
    RULE_711_7_ENCHANTMENTS_SUBTYPE_CLASS_ASSOCIATED_ABILITIES,

    // 712.1. A double-faced card has a Magic card face on one side and either a Magic card face or half of an oversized card face on the other. (It does not have a Magic card back.) There are three kinds of double-faced cards: nonmodal double-faced cards (previously called “transforming double-faced cards”), modal double-faced cards, and meld cards.
    RULE_712_1_DOUBLE_FACED_CARD_MAGIC_FACE,

    // 712.2. Nonmodal double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side and include abilities on one or both of their faces that allow the card to either “transform” or “convert” (turn over to its other face) and/or allow the card to be cast or enter the battlefield “transformed” or “converted” (with its back face up).
    // 712.2a. A nonmodal double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. On cards printed starting with The Brothers’ War™ release, that symbol is a single white triangle pointed upward inside a black circle. Nonmodal double-faced cards printed in older sets have different front-face symbols. On Magic Origins™ and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a modified Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad® block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich of the Krallenhorde in the Eldritch Moon™ set, the front-face symbol is a sun. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a full moon. On Ixalan® and Rivals of Ixalan™ cards, the front-face symbol is a compass rose. On Kamigawa®: Neon Dynasty double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a closed fan.
    // 712.2b. A nonmodal double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left or upper right corner. On cards printed starting with The Brothers’ War release, that symbol is a single white triangle pointed downward inside a black circle. Nonmodal double-faced cards printed in older sets have different front-face symbols. On Magic Origins and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a full Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha in the Eldritch Moon set, the back-face symbol is a crescent moon. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a stylized image of Emrakul. On Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan cards, the back-face symbol is a land icon. On Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is an open fan.
    // 712.2c. The front face of a nonmodal double-faced card whose back face is a creature has the back face’s power and toughness printed in gray above the power and toughness box. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.
    RULE_712_2_NONMODAL_DOUBLE_FACED_CARDS_MAGIC,

    // 712.3. Modal double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side. These faces are usually independent from one another, but they may have an ability that allows them to “transform” or “convert” on either face.
    // 712.3a. A modal double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. The front-face symbol is a single black triangle inside a sideways teardrop.
    // 712.3b. A modal double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. The back-face symbol is two white triangles inside a sideways teardrop.
    // 712.3c. Each face of a modal double-faced card includes a hint bar in the lower left corner with information about the opposite face. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.
    RULE_712_3_MODAL_DOUBLE_FACED_CARDS_MAGIC,

    // 712.4. Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized card face on the other.
    // 712.4a. One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined (see rule 701.42, “Meld”). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.
    // 712.4b. The back faces of a meld pair are used only to determine the characteristics of the melded permanent that pair becomes on the battlefield. If a rule or effect references the back face of a meld card when not part of a melded permanent on the battlefield, it fails to determine its characteristics, regardless of which parts of the melded permanent is represented on that card’s back face.
    // 712.4c. Unlike other double-faced cards, meld cards cannot be transformed or converted. Any instructions to do so are ignored.
    RULE_712_4_MELD_CARDS_MAGIC_FACE_SIDE(Condition),

    RULE_712_6_PLAYERS_ALLOWED_LOOK_DOUBLE_FACED(Condition),

    // 712.7. Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves and/or a substitute card (see rule 713). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule 100.6.
    RULE_712_7_PLAYERS_ENSURE_DOUBLE_FACED_CARDS,

    // 712.8. Each face of a double-faced card that isn’t a meld card has its own set of characteristics. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.
    // 712.8a. While a double-faced card is outside the game or in a zone other than the battlefield or stack, it has only the characteristics of its front face.
    // 712.8b. A meld card on the stack has only the characteristics of its front face.
    // 712.8c. Normally, a nonmodal double-faced spell has its front face up while on the stack and has only the characteristics of its front face. However, if an effect allows a player to cast a nonmodal double-faced card “transformed” or “converted,” the resulting spell will have its back face up and have only the characteristics of its back face. Its mana value is calculated using the mana cost of its front face.
    // 712.8d. While a double-faced permanent has its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.
    // 712.8e. While a nonmodal double-faced permanent has its back face up, it has only the characteristics of its back face. However, its mana value is calculated using the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent is copying the back face of a nonmodal double-faced permanent (even if the object representing that copy is itself a double-faced permanent), the mana value of that permanent is 0. See rule 202.3b.
    // 712.8f. While a modal double-faced spell is on the stack or a modal double-faced permanent is on the battlefield, it has only the characteristics of the face that’s up.
    // 712.8g. While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its mana value is the sum of the mana values of its front faces. If a permanent is copying a melded permanent, the mana value of the copy is 0. See rule 202.3c.

    // 724.1b. Exile every object on the stack, including the object that’s resolving. All objects not on the battlefield or in the command zone that aren’t represented by cards will cease to exist the next time state-based actions are checked (see rule 704, “State-Based Actions”).
    // 724.1c. Check state-based actions. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack.

    // 729.4a. Some effects can bring cards into a game from outside of it. If a card is brought into a subgame from a main game, abilities in the main game that trigger on objects leaving a main-game zone will trigger, but they won’t be put onto the stack until the main game resumes.
    // 729.4b. A player’s main-game counters aren’t considered part of the subgame, although the player will still have them when the main game resumes. Similarly, any counters a player gets during a subgame will cease to exist when the subgame ends.
    RULE_729_4_OBJECTS_MAIN_GAME_CARDS_OUTSIDE(Condition),

    // 729.5. At the end of a subgame, each player takes all traditional cards they own that are in the subgame other than those in the subgame command zone, puts them into their main-game library, then shuffles them. This includes cards in the subgame’s exile zone and cards that represent phased-out permanents as the subgame ends. Except as specified in rules 729.5a–c, all other objects in the subgame cease to exist, as do the zones created for the subgame. The main game continues from the point at which it was discontinued: First, the spell or ability that created the subgame finishes resolving, even if it was created by a spell card that’s no longer on the stack. Then, if any main-game abilities triggered while the subgame was in progress due to cards being removed from the main game, those abilities are put onto the stack.
    // 729.5a. At the end of a subgame, each nontraditional card not in a supplementary deck that began the subgame in a supplementary deck is turned face down and put on the bottom of that deck. Then each player moves each of their supplementary decks from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone and shuffles it.
    // 729.5b. At the end of a subgame of a Vanguard game, each player moves their vanguard card from the subgame command zone to the main-game command zone. This is an exception to rule 313.2.
    // 729.5c. At the end of a subgame of a Commander game, each player moves their commander from the subgame command zone (if it’s there) to the main-game command zone.
    RULE_729_5_END_SUBGAME_PLAYER_TRADITIONAL_CARDS(Condition),

    // 729.6. A subgame can be created within a subgame. The existing subgame becomes the main game in relation to the new subgame.
    RULE_729_6_SUBGAME_CREATED_EXISTING_BECOMES_MAIN,

    // 730.1. One keyword causes an object to merge with a permanent. See rule 702.140, “Mutate.”
    RULE_730_1_KEYWORD_CAUSES_OBJECT_MERGE_PERMANENT,

    // 730.2. To merge an object with a permanent, place that object on top of or under that permanent. That permanent becomes a merged permanent represented by the card or copy that represented that object in addition to any other components that were representing it.
    // 730.2a. A merged permanent has only the characteristics of its topmost component, unless otherwise specified by the effect that caused them to merge. This is a copiable effect whose timestamp is the time the objects merged. (See rule 613.2.)
    // 730.2b. As an object merges with a permanent, that object leaves its previous zone and becomes part of an object on the battlefield, but the resulting permanent isn’t considered to have just entered the battlefield.
    // 730.2c. Because a merged permanent is the same object that it was before, it hasn’t just come under a player’s control, any continuous effects that affected it continue to do so, and so on.
    // 730.2d. If a merged permanent contains a token, the resulting permanent is a token only if the topmost component is a token.
    // 730.2e. If a merged permanent contains face-up and face-down components, the permanent’s status is determined by its topmost component. If a face-down permanent becomes a face-up permanent as a result of an object merging with it, other effects don’t count it as being turned face up.
    // 730.2f. If a merged permanent is turned face down, each face-up component that represents it is turned face down. If a face-down merged permanent is turned face up, each face-down component that represents it is turned face up.
    // 730.2g. A face-down merged permanent that contains an instant or sorcery card can’t be turned face up. If such a permanent would turn face up, its controller reveals it and leaves it face down. Abilities that trigger when a permanent is turned face up won’t trigger.
    // 730.2h. If a merged permanent contains a flip card (see rule 710), that component’s alternative characteristics are used instead of its normal characteristics if the merged permanent is flipped.
    // 730.2i. A merged permanent is not a double-faced permanent even if it contains one or more double-faced components. If a merged permanent contains one or more double-faced components that can transform (see rule 712), transforming or converting that permanent causes each of those double-faced components to turn so that its other face is up.
    // 730.2j. A face-up merged permanent that contains a double-faced component can’t be turned face down.
    RULE_730_2_MERGE_OBJECT_PERMANENT_PLACE_TOP(Condition),

    // 730.3. If a merged permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and each of the individual components are put into the appropriate zone.
    // 730.3a. If a merged permanent is put into its owner’s graveyard or library, that player may arrange the new objects in any order. If it’s put into its owner’s library, that player doesn’t reveal the order.
    // 730.3b. If a player exiles a merged permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule 613.7m.
    // 730.3c. If an effect can find the new object that a merged permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it finds all of those objects. (See rule 400.7.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those objects, the same actions are taken upon each of them.
    // 730.3d. If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a merged permanent leaving the battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to the object applies it to all components of the object. If the merged permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rules 903.9b–c.
    // 730.3e. If a replacement effect applies to a “card” being put into a zone without also including tokens, that effect applies to all components of the merged permanent if it’s not a token, including components that are tokens. If the merged permanent is a token but some of its components are cards, the merged permanent and its token components are put into the appropriate zone, and the components that are cards are moved by the replacement effect.
    RULE_730_3_MERGED_PERMANENT_LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD_INDIVIDUAL(Condition),

    // 731.1. Day and night are designations that the game itself can have. The game starts with neither designation. “It becomes day” and “it becomes night” refer to the game gaining the day or night designation. It can become day or night through the daybound and nightbound keyword abilities (see rule 702.145). Other effects can also make it day or night. Once it has become day or night, the game will have exactly one of those designations from that point forward.
    // 731.1a. The phrases “day becomes night” and “night becomes day” refer to the game losing the first designation and gaining the second one.
    RULE_731_1_DAY_NIGHT_DESIGNATIONS_GAME_ITSELF,

    // 731.2. As the second part of the untap step, the game checks the previous turn to see if the game’s day/night designation should change. See rule 502, “Untap Step.”
    // 731.2a. If it’s day and the previous turn’s active player didn’t cast any spells during that turn, it becomes night. Multiplayer games using the shared team turns option (see rule 805) use a modified rule: if it’s day and no player from the previous turn’s active team cast a spell during that turn, it becomes night.
    // 731.2b. If it’s night, and previous turn’s active player cast two or more spells during the previous turn, it becomes day. Multiplayer games using the shared team turns option (see rule 805) use a modified rule: if it’s night and any player from the previous turn’s active team cast two or more spells during that turn, it becomes day.
    // 731.2c. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither.
    RULE_731_2_UNTAP_STEP_GAME_CHECKS_PREVIOUS(Condition),

    // 732.1. When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.
    // 732.1a. The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.
    // 732.1b. Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated indefinitely (thus creating a “loop”). In that case, the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions are repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is broken.
    // 732.1c. Tournaments use a modified version of the rules governing shortcuts and loops. These rules are covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.wizards.com/en/rules-documents). Whenever the Tournament Rules contradict these rules during a tournament, the Tournament Rules take precedence.
    RULE_732_1_PLAYING_GAME_PLAYERS_TYPICALLY_MUTUALLY(Condition),

    // 732.2. Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.
    // 732.2a. At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a shortcut by describing a sequence of game choices, for all players, that may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable results of the sequence of choices. This sequence may be a non-repetitive series of choices, a loop that repeats a specified number of times, multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns. It can’t include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next action a player takes. The ending point of this sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not be the player proposing the shortcut.
    // 732.2b. Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or shorten it by naming a place where they will make a game choice that’s different than what’s been proposed. (The player doesn’t need to specify at this time what the new choice will be.) This place becomes the new ending point of the proposed sequence.
    // 732.2c. Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken. The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player.
    RULE_732_2_SHORTCUT_PROCEDURE(Condition),

    // 732.3. Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.
    RULE_732_3_SOMETIMES_LOOP_FRAGMENTED_PLAYER_INVOLVED(Condition),

    // 732.4. If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules 104.4b and 104.4f.)
    RULE_732_4_LOOP_CONTAINS_MANDATORY_ACTIONS_GAME(Condition),

    // 732.5. No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.
    RULE_732_5_PLAYER_FORCED_PERFORM_ACTION_END(Condition),

    // 732.6. If a loop contains an effect that says “[A] unless [B],” where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as though [A] were mandatory.
    RULE_732_6_LOOP_CONTAINS_EFFECT_SAYS_B(Condition),

    // 733.1. If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but can’t legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was spent on another mana ability that wasn’t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.
    RULE_733_1_PLAYER_ILLEGAL_ACTION_STARTS_CANT(Condition),

    // 733.2. When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.
    RULE_733_2_REVERSING_ILLEGAL_SPELLS_ABILITIES_PLAYER(Condition),

    // --- 8. Multiplayer Rules ---

    // 800.1. A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.
    RULE_800_1_MULTIPLAYER_GAME_BEGINS_THAN_PLAYERS,

    // 800.2. These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.
    RULE_800_2_CONSIST_SERIES_OPTIONS_ADDED_MULTIPLAYER,

    // 800.3. Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.wizards.com/en/rules-documents.
    RULE_800_3_MANY_MULTIPLAYER_MAGIC_TOURNAMENTS_ADDITIONAL(Condition),

    // 800.4. Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.
    // 800.4a. When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule 109) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.
    // 800.4b. If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn’t. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren’t.
    // 800.4c. If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends.
    // 800.4d. If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isn’t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isn’t put on the stack.
    // 800.4e. If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn’t assigned.
    // 800.4f. If an object requires a player who has left the game to pay a cost or choose whether to pay a cost, that cost is not paid.
    // 800.4g. If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice other than whether to pay a cost, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.
    // 800.4h. If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice.
    // 800.4i. If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.
    // 800.4j. If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.
    // 800.4k. If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn’t begin.
    // 800.4m. When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.
    // 800.4n. When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule 800.4a. See rule 407, “Ante.”
    // 800.4p. In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. See rule 311.5.
    RULE_800_4_PLAYER_LEAVES_GAME_OBJECTS_OWNED(Condition),

    // 800.5. Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice to determine seating order, and so on.
    RULE_800_5_CHOSEN_VARIANT_OPTION_PRESCRIBES_OTHERWISE(Condition),

    // 800.6. In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
    RULE_800_6_MULTIPLAYER_GAME_MULLIGAN_PLAYER_DOESNT,

    // 800.7. In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn’t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule 103.8.
    RULE_800_7_MULTIPLAYER_GAME_THAN_HEADED_GIANT,

    // 801.1. Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule 809), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.
    RULE_801_1_LIMITED_RANGE_INFLUENCE_OPTION_APPLIED,

    // 801.2. A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.
    // 801.2a. The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.
    // 801.2b. A player is always within their own range of influence.
    // 801.2c. The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.
    // 801.2d. An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player. In addition, a battle is within a player’s range of influence if it’s protected by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.
    RULE_801_2_PLAYERS_RANGE_INFLUENCE_MAXIMUM_DISTANCE(Condition),

    // 801.3. Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence, planeswalkers controlled by those opponents, and battles protected by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player controls can’t attack.
    RULE_801_3_CREATURES_ATTACK_OPPONENTS_CONTROLLERS_RANGE(Condition),

    // 801.4. Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.
    RULE_801_4_OBJECTS_PLAYERS_OUTSIDE_RANGE_INFLUENCE,

    // 801.5. Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.
    // 801.5a. If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of influence.
    // 801.5b. If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player’s range of influence.
    // 801.5c. If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.
    RULE_801_5_CARDS_REQUIRE_PLAYERS_CHOICES_WORK(Condition),

    // 801.6. A player can’t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.
    RULE_801_6_PLAYER_CANT_ACTIVATE_ACTIVATED_ABILITIES,

    // 801.7. A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source’s controller.
    // 801.7a. If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rules 603.6 and 603.10.
    RULE_801_7_TRIGGERED_ABILITY_DOESNT_TRIGGER_EVENT(Condition),

    // 801.8. An Aura can’t enchant an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule 704.
    RULE_801_8_AURA_CANT_ENCHANT_OBJECT_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 801.9. An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence, and a Fortification can’t fortify an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.
    RULE_801_9_EQUIPMENT_CANT_EQUIP_OBJECT_OUTSIDE(Condition),

    // 801.10. Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.
    RULE_801_10_SPELLS_ABILITIES_CANT_AFFECT_OBJECTS,

    // 801.11. If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.
    RULE_801_11_SPELL_ABILITY_REQUIRES_GAME_CONTROLLERS(Condition),

    // 801.12. The “world rule” (see rule 704.5k) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller’s range of influence.
    RULE_801_12_WORLD_APPLIES_PERMANENT_CONTROLLERS_RANGE(Condition),

    // 801.13. Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule 614, “Replacement Effects,” and rule 615, “Prevention Effects.”
    // 801.13a. If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.
    // 801.13b. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only permanents and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence.
    RULE_801_13_REPLACEMENT_PREVENTION_EFFECTS_WATCH_EVENT(Condition),

    // 801.14. If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player’s opponents within that player’s range of influence lose the game instead.
    RULE_801_14_EFFECT_STATES_PLAYER_WINS_GAME(Condition),

    // 801.15. If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and all players within that player’s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
    RULE_801_15_EFFECT_SPELL_ABILITY_STATES_GAME(Condition),

    // 801.16. If the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
    RULE_801_16_GAME_SOMEHOW_ENTERS_LOOP_MANDATORY(Condition),

    // 801.17. Effects that restart the game (see rule 727) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.
    RULE_801_17_EFFECTS_RESTART_GAME_EXEMPT_LIMITED,

    // 801.18. In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    RULE_801_18_MULTIPLAYER_PLANECHASE_GAMES_THAN_GRAND,

    // 802.1. Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.
    RULE_802_1_MULTIPLAYER_GAMES_ALLOW_ACTIVE_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 802.2. As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn’t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking player’s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.
    // 802.2a. Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that player is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that player was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
    RULE_802_2_COMBAT_PHASE_STARTS_ATTACKING_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 802.3. As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player, a planeswalker controlled by a defending player, or a battle protected by a defending player for it to attack. See rule 508, “Declare Attackers Step.”
    // 802.3a. Restrictions and requirements that don’t apply to attacking a specific player are evaluated based on the entire group of attacking creatures. Restrictions and requirements that apply to attacking a specific player apply only to creatures attacking that player. The entire group of attacking creatures must still be legal. See rule 508.1.
    // 802.3b. Creatures in a band can’t attack different players. See rule 702.22, “Banding.”
    RULE_802_3_ATTACKING_PLAYER_DECLARES_CREATURE_CHOOSE,

    // 802.4. If more than one player is being attacked, controls a planeswalker that’s being attacked, or protects a battle that’s being attacked, each defending player in APNAP order declares blockers as the declare blockers step begins. (See rule 101.4 and rule 509, “Declare Blockers Step.”) The first defending player declares all their blocks, then the second defending player, and so on.
    // 802.4a. A defending player can block only with creatures they control. Those creatures can block only creatures attacking that player, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects.
    // 802.4b. When determining whether a defending player’s blocks are legal, ignore any creatures attacking other players and any blocking creatures controlled by other players.
    RULE_802_4_THAN_PLAYER_ATTACKED_CONTROLS_PLANESWALKER(Condition),

    // 802.5. Combat damage is assigned in APNAP order. Other than that, the combat damage step proceeds just as in a two-player game. See rule 510, “Combat Damage Step.”
    RULE_802_5_COMBAT_DAMAGE_ASSIGNED_APNAP_ORDER,

    // 803.1. Some multiplayer games use the optional attack left or attack right rules.
    // 803.1a. If the attack left option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their left, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the left is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.
    // 803.1b. If the attack right option is used, a player can attack only an opponent seated immediately to their right, a planeswalker that player controls, or a battle that player protects. If a player’s nearest opponent to the right is more than one seat away, the player can’t attack.
    RULE_803_1_MULTIPLAYER_GAMES_OPTIONAL_ATTACK_LEFT(Condition),

    // 804.1. The Emperor variant always uses the deploy creatures option, and it can be used in other variants that allow players to compete in teams. Multiplayer formats in which players compete as individuals usually don’t use this option.
    RULE_804_1_EMPEROR_VARIANT_DEPLOY_CREATURES_OPTION,

    // 804.2. Each creature has the ability “{T}: Target teammate gains control of this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.”
    RULE_804_2_CREATURE_ABILITY_TARGET_TEAMMATE_GAINS,

    // 805.1. Some multiplayer games between teams use the shared team turns option. It’s always used in the Two-Headed Giant variant (see rule 810) and the Archenemy casual variant (see rule 904). It can be used only if the members of each team are sitting in adjacent seats.
    RULE_805_1_MULTIPLAYER_GAMES_TEAMS_SHARED_TURNS(Condition),

    // 805.2. Within each team, the player seated in the rightmost seat from that team’s perspective is the primary player. If the players on a team can’t agree on a choice, such as which creatures attack or what order triggered abilities are put on the stack, the primary player makes that choice.
    RULE_805_2_TEAM_PLAYER_SEATED_RIGHTMOST_SEAT(Condition),

    // 805.3. The methods described in rule 103.1 are used to determine which team will take the first turn. The team determined this way is the starting team.
    // 805.3a. The process for handling mulligans is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, declares whether that player will take a mulligan. Then the players on each other team in turn order do the same. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then all mulligans are taken at the same time. Teammates may consult while choosing which cards, if any, to put on the bottom of their library. A player may take a mulligan even after a teammate has decided to keep their opening hand. See rule 103.5.
    // 805.3b. The process for handling cards that allow a player to begin the game with them on the battlefield is altered accordingly. First, each player on the starting team, in whatever order that team likes, may put any or all such cards onto the battlefield from that player’s opening hand. Teammates may consult while making their decisions. Then each player on each other team in turn order does the same.
    RULE_805_3_METHODS_TEAM_TURN_WAY_STARTING(Condition),

    // 805.4. Each team takes turns rather than each player.
    // 805.4a. The team whose turn it is is the active team. Each other team is a nonactive team.
    // 805.4b. Each player on a team draws a card during that team’s draw step.
    // 805.4c. Each player on a team may play a land during each of that team’s turns.
    // 805.4d. An ability that triggers at the beginning of a step or phase may trigger multiple times if it triggers at the beginning of “each player’s” or “each opponent’s” step or phase. These abilities trigger once for each appropriate player if the ability’s trigger condition, effect, or intervening “if” clause refers to “that player,” “that opponent,” or similar.
    RULE_805_4_TEAM_TURNS_RATHER_THAN_PLAYER(Condition),

    // 805.5. Teams have priority, not individual players.
    // 805.5a. A player may cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action when their team has priority.
    // 805.5b. If a team has priority and no player on that team wishes to do anything, that team passes. If all teams pass in succession (that is, if all teams pass without any player taking any actions in between passing), the top object on the stack resolves, then the active team receives priority. If the stack is empty when all teams pass in succession, the phase or step ends and the next one begins.
    RULE_805_5_TEAMS_PRIORITY_INDIVIDUAL_PLAYERS(Condition),

    // 805.6. The Active Player, Nonactive Player order rule (see rule 101.4) is modified if the shared team turns option is used. If multiple teams would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first the active team makes any choices required, then each nonactive team in turn order makes any choices required. If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, first each player on the active team makes any choices required in whatever order they like, then the players on each nonactive team in turn order do the same. Once all choices have been made, the actions happen simultaneously.
    // 805.6a. If more than one player is instructed to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared team turns option, first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs that player’s draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.
    RULE_805_6_ACTIVE_PLAYER_NONACTIVE_ORDER_MODIFIED(Condition),

    // 805.7. If multiple triggered abilities have triggered since the last time a team received priority, the members of the active team put all triggered abilities any of them controls on the stack in any order they choose, then the members of each nonactive team in turn order do the same.
    RULE_805_7_MULTIPLE_TRIGGERED_ABILITIES_LAST_TIME(Condition),

    // 805.8. If an effect gives a player an extra turn or adds a phase or step to that player’s turn, that player’s team takes the extra turn, phase, or step. If an effect causes a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, that player’s team does so. If a single effect causes more than one player on the same team to add or skip the same step, phase, or turn, that team adds or skips only that step, phase, or turn. If an effect causes a player to control another player, the first player controls the affected player’s team.
    RULE_805_8_EFFECT_PLAYER_EXTRA_TURN_ADDS(Condition),

    // 805.9. Any ability that refers to the “active player” refers to one specific active player, not to all of the active players. The ability’s controller chooses which one the ability refers to at the time its effect is applied.
    RULE_805_9_ABILITY_ACTIVE_PLAYER_CONTROLLER_CHOOSES(Condition),

    // 805.10. The shared team turns option uses different combat rules than other multiplayer options.
    // 805.10a. Each team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. During the combat phase, the active team is the attacking team and each player on the active team is an attacking player. Likewise, the nonactive team is the defending team and each player on the nonactive team is a defending player.
    // 805.10b. As the declare attackers step begins, the active team declares attackers. For each attacking creature, the attacking team announces which defending player, planeswalker, or battle that creature is attacking. The active team has one combined attack, and that set of attacking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 508.1.
    // 805.10c. Any rule, object, or effect that refers to an “attacking player” refers to one specific attacking player, not to all attacking players. If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified, the attacking player it’s referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
    // 805.10d. As the declare blockers step begins, the defending team declares blockers. Creatures controlled by the defending players can block creatures attacking any player on the defending team, attacking a planeswalker controlled by one of those players, or a battle protected by one of those players. The defending team has one combined block, and that set of blocking creatures must be legal as a whole. See rule 509.1.
    // 805.10e. Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
    // 805.10f. As the combat damage step begins, the active team announces how each attacking creature will assign its combat damage. Then the defending team announces how each blocking creature will assign its combat damage. See rule 510.1.
    RULE_805_10_SHARED_TEAM_COMBAT_BLOCK_DAMAGE(Condition),

    // 806.1. In Free-for-All multiplayer games, a group of players compete as individuals against each other.
    RULE_806_1_FREE_MULTIPLAYER_GAMES_GROUP_PLAYERS,

    // 806.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Free-for-All variant uses the following default options.
    // 806.2a. The limited range of influence option usually isn’t used in Free-for-All games. If it is, each player has the same range of influence, which is determined before play begins. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”
    // 806.2b. Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”

    // 808.3a. The attack multiple players option is used (see rule 802).
    // 808.3b. The deploy creatures options and limited range of influence options usually aren’t used in the Team vs. Team variant.
    RULE_808_3_MULTIPLAYER_OPTIONS_PLAY_BEGINS_TEAM,

    // 808.4. To determine which player goes first, randomly choose a team. If that team has an odd number of players, the player in its center seat goes first. If that team has an even number of players, the player to the left of its midpoint goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.
    RULE_808_4_PLAYER_RANDOMLY_CHOOSE_TEAM_ODD(Condition),

    // 808.5. In the Team vs. Team variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
    RULE_808_5_TEAM_VS_VARIANT_RESOURCES_CARDS(Condition),

    RULE_810_7_HEADED_GIANT_VARIANT_COMBAT_SHARED,

    // 810.8. The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule 104), with the following additions and specifications.
    // 810.8a. Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect says that a player can’t win the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect says that a player can’t lose the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.
    // 810.8b. If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.
    // 810.8c. If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 810.8d. If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    RULE_810_8_HEADED_GIANT_VARIANT_NORMAL_WINNING(Condition),

    // 810.9. Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the team’s shared life total.
    // 810.9a. If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that cost or effect uses the team’s life total instead.
    // 810.9b. If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life they pay may not exceed their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)
    // 810.9c. If an effect sets a single player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.
    // 810.9d. If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected.
    // 810.9e. A player can’t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the exchange won’t happen.

    // 810.9h. If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, no player on that player’s team can lose life or pay any amount of life other than 0.
    RULE_810_9_DAMAGE_LOSS_LIFE_GAINING_HAPPEN(Condition),

    // 810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.
    // 810.10a. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player’s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a player’s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.
    // 810.10b. If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player’s team loses that many poison counters.
    // 810.10c. If an effect says that a player can’t get poison counters, no player on that player’s team can get poison counters.
    // 810.10d. If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player’s team has. A player is “poisoned” if that player’s team has one or more poison counters.
    RULE_810_10_EFFECTS_CAUSE_PLAYERS_POISON_COUNTERS(Condition),

    // 810.11. The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players.

    RULE_900_1_CONTAINS_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONAL_CASUAL_GAME,

    // 900.2. The casual variants detailed here use supplemental zones, rules, cards, and other game implements not used in traditional Magic games.
    RULE_900_2_CASUAL_VARIANTS_DETAILED_SUPPLEMENTAL_ZONES,

    // 903.1. In the Commander variant, a variant created and popularized by fans, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck’s commander. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    RULE_903_1_COMMANDER_VARIANT_CREATED_POPULARIZED_FANS,

    // 903.2. A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
    RULE_903_2_COMMANDER_GAME_PLAYER_MULTIPLAYER_DEFAULT,

    // 903.3. Each deck has a legendary card designated as its commander. That card must be either (a) a creature card, (b) a Vehicle card, or (c) a Spacecraft card with one or more power/toughness boxes. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
    // 903.3a. Some cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule 113.6n.
    // 903.3b. If a player’s commander is a meld card and it’s melded with the other member of its meld pair, the resulting melded permanent is that player’s commander.
    // 903.3c. If a player’s commander is a component of a merged permanent, the resulting merged permanent is that player’s commander.
    // 903.3d. If an effect refers to controlling a commander, it refers to a permanent on the battlefield that is a commander. If an effect refers to casting a commander, it refers to a spell that is a commander. If an effect refers to a commander in a specific zone, it refers to a card in that zone that is a commander.
    // 903.3e. If an effect refers to a characteristic of “your commander,” it can find the appropriate player’s commander and see its current characteristics, as modified by continuous effects and other rules, in all zones, including that player’s library and hand.
    RULE_903_3_DECK_LEGENDARY_CARD_DESIGNATED_COMMANDER(Condition),

    // 903.4. The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card’s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule 604.3) or color indicator (see rule 204).
    // 903.4a. Color identity is established before the game begins. If a rule or effect refers to the color identity of an object in the game represented by a card, it uses the color identity established for that card as the game began.
    // 903.4b. If a commander has a static ability that causes a player to choose its color before the game begins, that choice applies during deck construction and throughout the game, even as the commander changes zones. That choice affects the commander’s color identity. The player reveals that choice as they put their commander into the command zone before the game begins. See rules 103.2c and 607.2p.
    // 903.4c. Reminder text is ignored when determining a card’s color identity. See rule 207.2.
    // 903.4d. The back face of a double-faced card (see rule 712) is included when determining a card’s color identity. This is an exception to rule 712.8a.
    // 903.4e. If a card has any alternative characteristics, such as those of adventurer cards (see rule 715, “Adventurer Cards”), those characteristics are included when determining the card’s color identity.
    // 903.4f. If an ability refers to the colors or number of colors in a commander’s color identity, that quality is undefined if that player doesn’t have a commander. That part of the ability won’t do anything. Costs that refer to that quality are unpayable.
    RULE_903_4_COMMANDER_VARIANT_COLOR_IDENTITY_CARDS(Condition),

    // 903.5. Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
    // 903.5a. Each deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 100.
    // 903.5b. Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule 201.3).
    // 903.5c. A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in the color identity of the deck’s commander.
    // 903.5d. A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could produce is included in the commander’s color identity.
    // 903.5e. Commander games do not use sideboards.
    RULE_903_5_COMMANDER_DECK_CONSTRUCTION_RESTRICTIONS(Condition),

    // 903.6. At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player’s library.
    RULE_903_6_START_GAME_PLAYER_PUTS_COMMANDER(Condition),

    // 903.7. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.
    RULE_903_7_ONCE_STARTING_PLAYER_SETS_LIFE,

    // 903.8. A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional {2} for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game. This additional cost is informally known as the “commander tax.”
    RULE_903_8_PLAYER_CAST_COMMANDER_OWN_COMMAND,

    // 903.9. A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.
    // 903.9a. If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. This is a state-based action. See rule 704.
    // 903.9b. If a commander would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.
    // 903.9c. If a commander is a melded permanent or a merged permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the command zone using the replacement effect described in rule 903.9b, that permanent and each component representing it that isn’t a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and is a commander is put into the command zone.
    RULE_903_9_COMMANDER_RETURN_COMMAND_ZONE_GAME(Condition),

    // 903.10. The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
    // 903.10a. A player who’s been dealt 21 or more combat damage by the same commander over the course of the game loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    RULE_903_10_PLAYER_WHOS_DEALT_COMBAT_DAMAGE,

    // 903.11. Except via rules, special actions, and effects that specifically bring cards into Commander games from outside the game, traditional cards from outside the game cannot be brought into a Commander game.
    // 903.11a. If a player is allowed to bring a card from outside the game into a Commander game, that player can’t bring a card into the game this way if it has the same name as a card that player had in their starting deck, if it has the same name as a card that the player owns in the current game, or if any color in its color identity isn’t in the color identity of the player’s commander.
    RULE_903_11_EXCEPT_VIA_SPECIAL_ACTIONS_EFFECTS(Condition),

    // 903.12. Brawl Option
    // 903.12a. Brawl is an option for a different style of Commander game. Brawl games use the normal rules for the Commander variant with the following modifications.
    // 903.12b. Brawl decks are usually constructed using cards from the Standard format.
    // 903.12c. Each deck has a legendary card designated as its commander. That card must be either (a) a creature card, (b) a planeswalker card, (c) a Vehicle card, or (d) a Spacecraft card with one or more power/toughness boxes.
    // 903.12d. A player’s deck must contain exactly 60 cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both 60.
    // 903.12e. If a player’s commander has no colors in its color identity, that player’s deck may contain any number of basic lands of one basic land type of their choice. This is an exception to rule 903.5d.
    // 903.12f. In a two-player Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 25. In a multiplayer Brawl game, each player’s starting life total is 30.
    // 903.12g. In any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
    // 903.12h. Brawl games do not use the state-based action described in rule 704.6c, which causes a player to lose the game if they’ve been dealt 21 or more combat damage by a commander.
    RULE_903_12_BRAWL_OPTION(Condition),

    // 903.13. Commander Draft
    // 903.13a. Commander Draft is an option for a different style of Commander game. It consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Commander Draft option uses Commander Legends booster packs by default.
    // 903.13b. A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts two cards by placing them in a face-down pile in front of them, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts two cards from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.
    // 903.13c. In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.
    // 903.13d. During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from and cards they have already drafted. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.
    // 903.13e. After the draft is complete, the cards a player drafted become that player’s card pool. If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends or Commander Masters, each player may add up to two cards named The Prismatic Piper to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player’s commander(s). If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur’s Gate®, each player may add up to two cards named Faceless One to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player’s commander(s).
    // 903.13f. Commander Draft deck construction follows the same rules as Commander deck construction (see rule 903.5) with three exceptions: (1) A player’s deck must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size. (2) A player’s deck may include any number of cards from that player’s card pool with the same name. (3) If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Masters, any card which can be a player’s commander by itself and whose color identity includes one or fewer colors is considered to have the partner ability for the purposes of deckbuilding. (See rule 702.124, “Partner.”)
    // 903.13g. Commander Draft games follow the same rules as Commander games. See rules 903.6–903.11.

    // =========================================================================
    // GENERATED CORE AND ESOTERIC RULES (CHAPTERS 1-9)
    // =========================================================================

    // --- ESOTERIC AND CASUAL PLAY VARIANTS PLACEHOLDERS ---

    // Placeholder for Card Attributes
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 123.1. A sticker is a marker placed on an object that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect. Stickers are not objects. Notably, a sticker is not a counter or a token. Changes to an object from stickers are not part of its copiable values. There are four kinds of stickers: name stickers; ability stickers; power and toughness stickers; and art stickers.
    // 123.2. Stickers are found in boosters of the Unfinity expansion on numbered inserts. Each insert has a predetermined combination of stickers. Any rule that refers to a sticker sheet refers to the specific combination of stickers found on one of those inserts. Sticker sheets are not cards and have no characteristics. Each sticker sheet can be found at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
    // 123.2a. In constructed play, a player who chooses to play with stickers must start the game with at least ten sticker sheets selected before play begins, and each of their sticker sheets must be unique. There is no maximum number of sticker sheets a player may start the game with. Each player playing with sticker sheets reveals all of their sticker sheets and chooses three of them at random. See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”
    // 123.2b. In limited play, each player chooses up to three sticker sheets from among those in the sealed products they opened and reveals them. See rule 103, “Starting the Game.”
    // 123.2c. Each player has access to only the stickers on the chosen sheets during the game, and those sticker sheets remain revealed.
    // 123.3. If an effect instructs a player to put a sticker on an object, that player chooses a sticker that is not currently on any objects they own from among the stickers they have access to and puts it on that object.
    // 123.3a. Each sticker a player has access to is discrete and is distinct from each other sticker they have access to. Two stickers are never considered to be the same sticker, even if they have the same text or information on them.
    // 123.3b. A player can’t put a sticker on an object that they don’t own. If an effect would cause them to do so, that part of the effect does nothing.
    // 123.3c. A sticker may have a ticket cost represented by a number inside a ticket symbol (see rule 107.17a). In order to put a sticker with a ticket cost on an object, the player who owns that object must pay that much {TK}. If they don’t have that much {TK}, they can’t put that sticker on an object.
    // 123.3d. If a sticker that is already on an object is moved to another object, that sticker’s ticket cost does not need to be paid again.
    // 123.4. Some rules and effects refer to a “stickered” object. An object is “stickered” if it currently has any kind of sticker on it. An object without any stickers on it is not a stickered object, even if it previously had stickers on it.
    // 123.5. Stickers on an object are not retained as that object moves to a hidden zone. Stickers are retained as that object moves to a public zone and continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone; this is an exception to rule 400.7.
    // 123.5a. If one or more cards with stickers on them enter the battlefield as part of a melded permanent, all of those stickers are on the permanent that object becomes on the battlefield. They maintain their relative timestamp order.
    // 123.5b. If an object with a sticker on it becomes a component of a merged permanent on the battlefield, that sticker is on that merged permanent.
    // 123.5c. If a melded or merged permanent with one or more stickers on it moves from the battlefield to another public zone, only one of the objects it becomes will retain those stickers. Its owner chooses which of the objects it becomes in its new zone retains any stickers that are on it. Effects from those stickers will continue to apply to only that object.
    // 123.6. A name sticker consists only of one or more words. A name sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes the word on that sticker to be added to the text of that object’s name. This is a text-changing effect. See rule 613.1c and rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects.”
    // 123.6a. For the purposes of rules and effects related to name stickers, a “word” in an object’s name is any series of non-space characters that are separated from other non-space characters by one or more spaces. Hyphenated words and words with punctuation are considered to be one word. Blank lines, such as the one in “Wolf in ________ Clothing,” are not considered words in a card’s name.
    // 123.6b. As a name sticker is placed on an object, that object’s controller chooses a position in that object’s name for the word in the name sticker to be added, then announces that object’s new name. That word can be added at the beginning of the object’s name or after any number of the other words that are currently in its name. The new name can be further modified by other name stickers. If that object has no name, its name becomes the word added by the name sticker. Name stickers never modify or remove any of the other words in that name.
    // 123.6c. The text that a name sticker is modifying may change due to other effects and/or a permanent’s face-down status (see rule 708, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents”). To determine the name of an object with one or more name stickers, start with the object’s copiable values, then apply each name sticker’s effect and each other text-changing effect in timestamp order. The position of each name sticker will continue to be after the number of words that were before it in the object’s name when it was placed. If there are fewer words in the object’s current name, the word on that sticker is added at the end of its name instead. The position and timestamp order of each name sticker on an object is remembered as the object that sticker is on moves from one public zone to another, and it continues to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone (see rule 123.5). This is an exception to rule 400.7.
    // 123.6d. Some effects refer to the number of one or more specific letters on a name sticker. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
    // 123.6e. Some effects refer to the number of “unique vowels” on a name sticker. These count the number of different vowels that appear on that sticker, even if one or more of them appear more than once. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
    // 123.7. An ability sticker is a sticker with one or more abilities printed on it. An ability sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object to gain the ability that is printed on that sticker. See rule 613.1f.
    // 123.7a. If an effect refers to an ability of an ability sticker, it refers to the ability that sticker grants to the object it is on, even if the object it is on doesn’t currently have that ability due to another effect.
    // 123.8. A power and toughness sticker is a sticker that has two numbers and a slash printed on it, resembling the power and toughness of a creature card. A power and toughness sticker on a creature or on a creature or Vehicle card in a zone other than the battlefield sets that object’s power and toughness to the values printed on that sticker (see rule 613.4b). If more than one power and toughness sticker is on a creature, use timestamp order to determine which one takes precedence (see rule 613.7).
    // 123.8a. An effect that refers to the power and/or toughness of a sticker refers only to the printed power and/or toughness values on a power and toughness sticker. It does not refer to any printed value on any other stickers.
    // 123.9. An art sticker on a permanent has no effect on game play other than to act as a marker that other spells and abilities can identify.
    // 717.1. Attraction is an artifact subtype seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Each Attraction has an “Astrotorium” card back rather than a traditional Magic card back and has a column of circled numbers on the right side of its text box. Numbers in white text on a brightly colored background are said to be “lit up” on those cards. Note that multiple Attraction cards with the same English name may have different numbers lit up. You can see each Attraction card’s possible combinations of lights at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
    // 717.2. Attraction cards do not begin the game in a player’s deck and do not count toward maximum or minimum deck sizes. Rather, a player who chooses to play with Attraction cards begins the game with a supplementary Attraction deck that exists in the command zone. Each Attraction deck is shuffled before the game begins (see rule 103.3a).
    // 717.2a. In constructed play, an Attraction deck must contain at least ten Attraction cards and each card in an Attraction deck must have a different English name.
    // 717.2b. In limited play, an Attraction deck must contain at least three Attraction cards from that player’s card pool, and may contain multiple Attractions cards with the same English name.
    // 717.3. Effects can cause an Attraction card to enter the battlefield from the command zone. See rule 701.51, “Open an Attraction.”
    // 717.4. As a player’s precombat main phase begins, a player who controls one or more Attractions rolls to visit their Attractions. See rules 703.4g and 701.52, “Roll to Visit Your Attractions.” This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
    // 717.5. Each Attraction card has an ability that begins with the word “Visit” followed by a long dash in its rules text. This is a visit ability. A visit ability triggers whenever you roll to visit your Attractions and the result matches one of the lit-up numbers. See rule 702.159, “Visit.”
    // 717.6. If a card with an Astrotorium card back would be put into a zone other than the battlefield, exile, or the command zone from anywhere, instead its owner puts it into the command zone. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule 614.5.
    // 717.6a. Each card owned by the same player that has been put in the command zone this way is kept in a single face-up pile separate from any player’s Attraction deck. This pile is informally referred to as that player’s “junkyard.” The pile is not its own zone.
    ESOTERIC_CARD_ATTRIBUTES,

    // Placeholder for Card Types
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 311.1. Plane is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses plane cards. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    // 311.2. Plane cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a plane card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 311.3. Plane subtypes are listed after a long dash, and may be multiple words: “Plane — Serra’s Realm.” All words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype. Planar subtypes are called planar types. A plane can have only one subtype. See rule 205.3n for the complete list of planar types.
    // 311.4. A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a plane card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 311.5. The controller of a face-up plane card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 311.6. A face-up plane card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 311.7. Each plane card has a triggered ability that triggers “Whenever chaos ensues.” These are called chaos abilities. Each one is indicated by a chaos symbol to the left of the ability, though the symbol itself has no special rules meaning. This ability triggers if the chaos symbol is rolled on the planar die (see rule 901.9b), if a resolving spell or ability says that chaos ensues, or if a resolving spell or ability states that chaos ensues for a particular object. In the last case, the chaos ability can trigger even if that plane card is still in the planar deck but revealed. A chaos ability is controlled by the current planar controller.
    // 312.1. Phenomenon is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Planechase casual variant uses phenomenon cards. See rule 901, “Planechase.”
    // 312.2. Phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a phenomenon card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 312.3. Phenomenon cards have no subtypes.
    // 312.4. The controller of a face-up phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 312.5. Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you encounter it. “When you encounter [this phenomenon]” means “When you move this card off a planar deck and turn it face up.”
    // 312.6. A face-up phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 312.7. If a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isn’t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action; see rule 704. See also rule 701.31, “Planeswalk.”)
    // 313.1. Vanguard is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Vanguard casual variant uses vanguard cards. See rule 902, “Vanguard.”
    // 313.2. Vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 313.3. Vanguard cards have no subtypes.
    // 313.4. A vanguard card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a vanguard card is in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 313.5. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
    // 313.6. Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied to the starting hand size and maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner (normally seven). The resulting number is both how many cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and their maximum hand size. See rule 103.5.
    // 313.7. Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard card’s owner (normally 20) to is determined. See rule 103.4.
    // 314.1. Scheme is a card type seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Only the Archenemy casual variant uses scheme cards. See rule 904, “Archenemy.”
    // 314.2. Scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a scheme deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a scheme card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
    // 314.3. Scheme cards have no subtypes.
    // 314.4. A scheme card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a scheme card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 314.5. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
    // 314.6. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 314.7. If an ability of a scheme card includes the text “this scheme,” it means the scheme card in the command zone that’s the source of that ability. This is an exception to rule 109.2.
    // 315.1. Conspiracy cards are used only in limited play, particularly in the Conspiracy Draft variant (see rule 905). Conspiracy cards aren’t used in constructed play.
    // 315.2. At the start of a game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. (See rule 702.106, “Hidden Agenda.”)
    // 315.3. Conspiracy cards remain in the command zone throughout the game. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast or included in a deck. If a conspiracy card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone. Conspiracy cards that aren’t in the game can’t be brought into the game.
    // 315.4. Conspiracy cards have no subtypes.
    // 315.5. Conspiracy cards may have any number of static or triggered abilities. As long as a conspiracy card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, and its triggered abilities may trigger.
    // 315.5a. Abilities of conspiracy cards may affect the start-of-game procedure.
    // 315.5b. Face-down conspiracy cards have no characteristics.
    // 315.6. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
    // 315.7. At any time, you may look at a face-down conspiracy card you control. You can’t look at face-down conspiracy cards controlled by other players.
    ESOTERIC_CARD_TYPES,

    // Placeholder for Special Actions
    // Covers the following rules:
    ESOTERIC_SPECIAL_ACTIONS,

    // Placeholder for Mechanics
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 719.1. Each Case card’s illustration is vertically oriented on the left side of the card, and its type line is along the bottom of the card.
    // 719.2. The Case frame has no additional rules meaning.
    // 719.3. Case cards have two special keyword abilities that appear before a long dash and represent a triggered ability and an ability that may be static, triggered, or activated.
    // 719.3a. “To solve — [Condition]” means “At the beginning of your end step, if [condition] and this Case is not solved, this Case becomes solved.”
    // 719.3b. Solved is a designation a permanent can have. It has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that spells and abilities can identify. Once a permanent becomes solved, it stays solved until it leaves the battlefield. The solved designation is neither an ability nor part of the permanent’s copiable values.
    // 719.3c. If a Case has the solved designation, “Solved — [Ability text]” is an ability that may affect the game if it’s a static ability, it may trigger if it’s a triggered ability, and it can be activated if it’s an activated ability. See rule 702.169, “Solved.”
    // 720.1. Omen cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
    // 720.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.
    // 720.2a. If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that “has an Omen,” it refers to an object that has the alternative characteristics of an Omen spell, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.
    // 720.2b. The existence and values of these alternative characteristics are part of the object’s copiable values.
    // 720.2c. Although omen cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each omen card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an omen card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
    // 720.3. As a player casts an omen card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Omen.
    // 720.3a. When casting an omen card as an Omen, only the alternative characteristics are evaluated to see if it can be cast.
    // 720.3b. While on the stack as an Omen, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.
    // 720.3c. If an Omen spell is copied, the copy is also an Omen. It has the alternative characteristics of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Omen spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as an Omen refers to the copy as well.
    // 720.3d. As an Omen spell resolves, its controller shuffles it into its owner’s library instead of putting it into its owner’s graveyard as it resolves.
    // 720.4. In every zone except the stack, and while on the stack not as an Omen, an omen card has only its normal characteristics.
    // 720.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose an omen card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
    // 721.1. Each station card has a striated text box and may have one or more power/toughness boxes. The text box of a station card contains one or two station symbols. Station cards also usually have the station keyword ability (see rule 702.184).
    // 721.2. A station symbol represents a static ability. The station symbol includes a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “{N+}.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a station symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of any power and toughness boxes printed within that striation, indicated here as [P/T].
    // 721.2a. “{N+}[abilities]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities].”
    // 721.2b. “{N+}[abilities][P/T]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities] and is a creature with base power and toughness [P/T] in addition to its other types.”
    // 721.2c. While in any zone other than the battlefield, station cards do not have power or toughness.
    // 721.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which station symbol. Station cards each contain only one text box.
    // 721.4. Any ability a station card has that isn’t preceded by a station symbol is treated normally. In particular, each station card has its station ability (see rule 702.184) at all times. That ability may be activated regardless of how many charge counters are on it.
    // 722.1. Preparation cards have a two-part card frame, with a smaller frame inset within their text box.
    // 722.2. The text that appears in the inset frame on the right defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the left.
    // 722.2a. The inset frame of a preparation card is called a “prepare spell.” If a rule or effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that has a prepare spell, it refers to an object for which these alternative characteristics exist, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.
    // 722.2b. The existence and values of these alternative characteristics are part of the object’s copiable values.
    // 722.2c. Although preparation cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each preparation card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a preparation card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
    // 722.3. Preparation cards can’t be cast using the alternative characteristics found within their inset frames. Rather, these characteristics are used to define characteristics of copies which may be cast.
    // 722.3a. Some spells and abilities cause a permanent with a prepare spell to become prepared or state that a permanent enters prepared. If that permanent has the alternative characteristics of a prepare spell, this gives the permanent the “prepared” designation. Prepared is a designation that acts as a marker which rules and effects can identify. A permanent can’t gain this designation unless it has a prepare spell, Additionally, a permanent can’t gain this designation if the permanent already has it.
    // 722.3b. A rule or effect may cause a permanent to become “unprepared.” This removes the prepared designation from that permanent.
    // 722.3c. As a permanent with a prepare spell gains the prepared designation or phases in prepared, its controller creates a copy of that object in exile, except that copy has only the characteristics of that permanent’s prepare spell, ignoring other exceptions to the copying process that apply to that permanent. Those characteristics become the copy’s normal characteristics. This copy remains in exile for as long as the prepared permanent remains on the battlefield and has the prepared designation. This is an exception to rule 704.5e. For as long as the copy remains in exile, the prepared permanent’s controller may cast the copy. That permanent loses the prepared designation at the time the spell becomes cast (see rule 601.2i).
    // 722.3d. If a prepare spell is copied, the copy is also a prepare spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as a prepare spell refers to the copy as well.
    // 722.4. In every zone, a preparation card has only its normal characteristics.
    // 722.5. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a preparation card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
    // 728.1. Rad counters are a kind of counter a player can have (see rule 122, “Counters”). There is an inherent triggered ability associated with rad counters. This ability has no source and is controlled by the active player. This is an exception to rule 113.8. The full text of this ability is “At the beginning of each player’s precombat main phase, if that player has one or more rad counters, that player mills a number of cards equal to the number of rad counters they have. For each nonland card milled this way, that player loses 1 life and removes one rad counter from themselves.”
    // 728.1a. A card that refers to life loss “from radiation” refers to life lost as a result of the triggered ability associated with rad counters.
    ESOTERIC_MECHANICS,

    // Placeholder for Multiplayer Variants
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 807.1. The Grand Melee variant is a modification of the Free-for-All variant, in which a group of players compete against each other as individuals. Grand Melee is normally used only in games begun with ten or more players.
    // 807.2. Any multiplayer options used are decided before play begins. The Grand Melee variant uses the following default options.
    // 807.2a. Each player has a range of influence of 1 (see rule 801).
    // 807.2b. The attack left option is used (see rule 803).
    // 807.2c. The attack multiple players and deploy creatures options aren’t used in the Grand Melee variant.
    // 807.3. The players are seated at random.
    // 807.4. The Grand Melee variant allows multiple players to take turns at the same time. Moving turn markers keep track of which players are currently taking turns. Each turn marker represents an active player’s turn.
    // 807.4a. There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.
    // 807.4b. The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player’s left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time.
    // 807.4c. After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately.
    // 807.4d. A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.
    // 807.4e. If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.
    // 807.4f. For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule 807.4e), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.
    // 807.4g. If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who’s not taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one.
    // 807.4h. If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats don’t enter one another’s range of influence until the next turn begins.
    // 807.4i. If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.
    // 807.4j. If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.
    // 807.5. Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.
    // 807.5a. A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.
    // 807.5b. If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can’t target objects on multiple stacks.
    // 809.1. The Emperor variant involves two or more teams of three players each.
    // 809.2. Each team sits together on one side of the table. Each team decides the order in which it’s seated. Each team has one emperor, who sits in the middle of the team. The remaining players on the team are generals whose job is to protect the emperor.
    // 809.3. The Emperor variant uses the following default options.
    // 809.3a. The range of influence is limited to 2 for emperors and 1 for generals. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”
    // 809.3b. Emperor games use the deploy creatures option (see rule 804).
    // 809.3c. A player can attack only an opponent seated immediately next to them, a planeswalker controlled by a player seated immediately next to them, or a battle protected by a player seated immediately next to them.
    // 809.4. Randomly determine which emperor goes first. Turn order goes to the players’ left.
    // 809.5. The Emperor variant includes the following specifications for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule 104.)
    // 809.5a. A team wins the game if its emperor wins.
    // 809.5b. A team loses the game if its emperor loses.
    // 809.5c. The game is a draw for a team if the game is a draw for its emperor.
    // 809.6. The Emperor variant can also be played with any number of equally sized teams. If the teams have more than three players, the range of influence of each player should be adjusted.
    // 809.6a. Each general’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows one general from an opposing team to begin the game within their range of influence. Each emperor’s range of influence should be the minimum number that allows two generals from opposing teams to begin the game within their range of influence. Players should be seated such that no emperor begins the game within the range of influence of another emperor.
    // 809.7. In the Emperor variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates may review each other’s hands and discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
    // 811.1. Alternating Teams games are played with two or more teams of equal size.
    // 811.2. Any multiplayer options used are determined before play begins. The Alternating Teams variant uses the following default options.
    // 811.2a. The recommended range of influence is 2. See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”
    // 811.2b. Exactly one of the attack left, attack right, and attack multiple players options must be used. See rule 803, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule 802, “Attack Multiple Players Option.”
    // 811.2c. The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.
    // 811.3. At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.
    // 811.4. A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them, planeswalkers that aren’t controlled by opponents seated next to them, or battles that aren’t protected by opponents seated next to them.
    // 811.5. In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared. Teammates can’t review each other’s hands unless they are sitting next to each other. Teammates may discuss strategies at any time. Teammates can’t manipulate each other’s cards or permanents.
    ESOTERIC_MULTIPLAYER_VARIANTS,

    // Placeholder for Casual Variants
    // Covers the following rules:
    // 901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
    // 901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a supplementary planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 311, “Planes,” and rule 312, “Phenomena.”)
    // 901.3a. A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol. One face has the chaos symbol. The other faces are blank.
    // 901.4. All plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up.
    // 901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule 103.7.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.
    // 901.6. The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
    // 901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 901.7a. A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
    // 901.8. Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the “planeswalking ability.” The full text of this ability is “Whenever you roll the Planeswalker symbol on the planar die, planeswalk.” (See rule 701.31, “Planeswalk.”) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule 113.8.
    // 901.9. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn’t use the stack. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule 116.2i.)
    // 901.9a. If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.
    // 901.9b. If the die roll is the chaos symbol, chaos ensues (see rule 311.7). The active player gets priority.
    // 901.9c. If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol, the “planeswalking ability” triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule 901.8.)
    // 901.9d. Rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See 706, “Rolling a Die.”
    // 901.10. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.
    // 901.10a. If a plane leaves the game while a “planeswalking ability” is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.
    // 901.10b. Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.
    // 901.11. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has “planeswalked.” Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule 701.31.
    // 901.11a. A player may planeswalk as the result of the “planeswalking ability” (see rule 901.8), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule 901.10), or because a phenomenon’s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule 704.6f). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.
    // 901.11b. The plane card that’s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.
    // 901.11c. If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.
    // 901.12. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.
    // 901.12a. Each player has their own planar deck.
    // 901.12b. The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller’s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller’s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.
    // 901.12c. Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to “you” applies to both members of the planar controller’s team.
    // 901.12d. Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player’s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.
    // 901.13. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule 801, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”)
    // 901.14. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.
    // 901.14a. Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule 901.5). Each of them is a planar controller.
    // 901.14b. If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.
    // 901.15. Single Planar Deck Option
    // 901.15a. As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can’t contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.
    // 901.15b. In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck.
    // 901.15c. If any rule or ability refers to a player’s planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.
    // 902.1. In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 902.2. A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
    // 902.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner’s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.
    // 902.4. Each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.5. Each player’s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.5a. If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand equal to their starting hand size. (In a multiplayer game, a player’s first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule 103.5.
    // 902.5b. A player’s maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
    // 902.6. The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.
    // 902.7. Any abilities of a face-up vanguard card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 904.1. In the Archenemy variant, a team of players faces off against a single opponent strengthened with powerful scheme cards. The Archenemy variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
    // 904.2. The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule 808) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) and the shared team turns option (see rule 805) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.
    // 904.2a. One of the teams consists of exactly one player, who is designated the archenemy.
    // 904.2b. The other team consists of any number of players.
    // 904.3. In addition to the normal game materials, the archenemy needs a supplementary scheme deck of at least twenty scheme cards. A scheme deck may contain no more than two of any card with a particular English name. (See rule 314, “Schemes.”)
    // 904.4. All scheme cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a scheme deck and while they’re face up.
    // 904.5. The archenemy’s starting life total is 40. Each other player’s starting life total is 20.
    // 904.6. Rather than a randomly determined player, the archenemy takes the first turn of the game.
    // 904.7. The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
    // 904.8. Any abilities of a face-up scheme card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
    // 904.9. Immediately after the archenemy’s precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called “setting that scheme in motion.” (See rule 701.32.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger “When you set this scheme in motion” trigger.
    // 904.10. If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 904.11. Once an ongoing scheme card is set in motion, it remains face up in the command zone until an ability causes it to be abandoned (see rule 701.33).
    // 904.12. Supervillain Rumble Option
    // 904.12a. As an alternative option, players may play a Free-for-All game in which each player has their own scheme deck. The attack multiple players option (see rule 802) is used; no other multiplayer options are used.
    // 904.12b. Each player in this game is an archenemy.
    // 904.12c. As in a normal Free-for-All game, the starting player is randomly determined. All other rules that apply to the archenemy in an Archenemy game apply to each player in a Supervillain Rumble game.
    // 904.13. Archenemy Commander Option
    // 904.13a. As an alternative option, players may play a Commander game (see rule 903, “Commander”) using the Archenemy rules. The normal rules for Commander apply, as modified by the Archenemy rules, with the following exceptions.
    // 904.13b. The archenemy starts with 60 life. The opposing team has a shared life total that starts at 60 life rather than individual life totals. The use of a shared life total is detailed in rules 810.8 and 810.9 of the Two-Headed Giant variant.
    // 904.13c. Poison counters are not shared. If the archenemy has ten or more poison counters, they lose the game. If any individual member of the opposing team has ten or more poison counters, they lose the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
    // 904.13d. The archenemy’s scheme deck must contain at least ten cards, and each card must have a different English name.
    // 905.1. The Conspiracy Draft variant consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Conspiracy Draft variant uses Magic: The Gathering—Conspiracy® and/or Conspiracy: Take the Crown booster packs by default.
    // 905.1a. A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.
    // 905.1b. In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.
    // 905.1c. During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from, cards they have already drafted, cards that are currently revealed as described in rule 905.2b, and cards that have been drafted face up as described in rule 905.2c. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.
    // 905.1d. After the draft and all actions that may be taken during or after the draft, all the cards a player has drafted become that player’s card pool. The player builds their deck from only these cards and any number of basic land cards. See rules 100.2b and 100.4b.
    // 905.2. Some cards have abilities that function during the draft.
    // 905.2a. During a draft, there is no active player or system of priority. If multiple players wish to take an action at the same time during the draft and can’t agree on an order, those actions are taken in a random order.
    // 905.2b. Some cards instruct players to reveal them as they’re drafted and then note some information, such as a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game. Any player can look at this information at any time during the draft or game. After the information is noted, the drafted card is turned face down and added to the player’s drafted cards pile.
    // 905.2c. Some cards instruct players to draft them face up. Each such card remains face up until the draft is complete, an effect instructs the player who drafted it to turn it face down, or the card leaves that player’s drafted cards pile. While the card is face up, all players may look at it.
    // 905.3. A Conspiracy Draft game is a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule 806, “Free-for-All Variant.”
    // 905.4. At the start of the game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone.
    // 905.4a. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. Any time a player has priority, they may turn a face-down conspiracy card they control face up. See rule 702.106, “Hidden Agenda.”
    // 905.5. The owner of a conspiracy card is the player who put it into the command zone at the start of the game. The controller of a conspiracy card is its owner.
    // 905.6. Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 20 and draws a hand of seven cards.
